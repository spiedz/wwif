      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of setting up a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS into specific implementation steps, including project initialization, dependency installation, configuration of Tailwind with custom colors, folder structure setup, and Vercel deployment preparation.",
      "reasoning": "This is a foundational task with moderate complexity. While Next.js setup is straightforward, the additional requirements for TypeScript integration, Tailwind configuration with custom colors, specific folder structure, and environment variable setup increase complexity slightly. The task is well-defined with clear deliverables."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Markdown parsing and dynamic routing",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific steps needed to implement a Markdown parsing system with frontmatter support, including library selection, parser configuration, metadata extraction, dynamic route implementation for both film and blog content, and static site generation optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical components: Markdown parsing with frontmatter, dynamic routing for two content types, and static site generation. Each component requires specific implementation details and integration work. The complexity comes from ensuring these systems work together seamlessly while handling various metadata fields correctly."

    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create core page layouts and components",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the development of core page layouts and components into specific implementation tasks, including the creation of each component (FilmPage, BlogPost, LocationCard, AffiliateLink), responsive layout implementation, navigation system, and ensuring design consistency across components.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple complex components that form the foundation of the site. Each component has its own requirements and complexity. The task also requires ensuring responsive design and consistent styling across all components. The interdependencies between components and their integration into a cohesive system increases the overall complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Google Maps integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps required to implement Google Maps integration, including API setup, component creation, marker implementation for multiple locations, info window functionality, responsive design considerations, and error handling strategies.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating with external APIs like Google Maps involves moderate complexity. The task requires handling API keys securely, implementing markers with custom data, creating info windows, ensuring responsive behavior, and implementing proper error handling. These requirements increase the complexity beyond a basic implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Build comment system functionality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a comment system into specific tasks, including UI component creation, backend storage selection and implementation, comment submission functionality, comment retrieval and display, spam prevention mechanisms, and styling integration.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both frontend and backend work, making it more complex. The developer needs to create UI components, implement data storage (with multiple options to evaluate), handle form submission, implement spam prevention, and ensure the design matches the site's aesthetic. The full-stack nature of this task increases its complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement SEO optimization and metadata",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific steps needed to implement comprehensive SEO optimization, including dynamic meta tag components, Open Graph and Twitter Card implementation, JSON-LD schema for different content types, sitemap generation, and robots.txt configuration.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing various SEO features across different standards (meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD). While each individual component is straightforward, ensuring they all work together correctly and dynamically based on content increases complexity. The task requires understanding of multiple SEO standards and their implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Enhance blog post layout and features",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the enhancement of blog post layouts into specific implementation tasks, including visual layout improvements, table of contents generation, custom styling for various content elements, image gallery implementation, map embedding, author section creation, and related posts functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves enhancing an existing component with multiple new features. Each feature (table of contents, custom styling, image galleries, map embedding, author section, related posts) requires specific implementation work. The complexity comes from ensuring all these features work together harmoniously while maintaining performance and design consistency."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Create About page",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific steps needed to create a comprehensive About page, including content section development, contact form implementation, social media integration, responsive design implementation, and animation/transition effects.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward compared to others. It primarily involves content creation and layout implementation using existing design patterns. The contact form adds some complexity, but overall this is a well-defined task with clear deliverables and moderate technical requirements."
