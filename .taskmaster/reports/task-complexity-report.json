      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Location-Based Content Feature with Interactive Map' task into 7 distinct subtasks, each focusing on one of the major components: route structure implementation, location data management, interactive map integration, content management system extension, SEO optimization, travel content integration, and mobile responsiveness. For each subtask, provide a clear title, description, acceptance criteria, and estimated complexity (1-5).",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to multiple interconnected components requiring both frontend and backend development. It involves route structure implementation, data schema design, third-party API integration (Google Maps), content management extensions, SEO optimization, travel-specific features, and responsive design considerations. The task has 7 major components with multiple sub-requirements in each, dependencies on 6 other tasks, and requires comprehensive testing across functionality, SEO, performance, responsive design, integration, and user acceptance. The high priority and extensive testing strategy further indicate its complexity."
