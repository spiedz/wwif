## üì∏ Photography Tips

Helsinki is a photographer's dream. Here's how to capture its cinematic essence.

### **Best Shots & Instagram-Worthy Spots**
*   **Helsinki Cathedral:** From the square, capture the full facade. For unique angles, try shots from nearby buildings or across the street. Sunrise or sunset for golden light.
*   **Suomenlinna:** Frame the cannon against the sea. Explore the tunnels for moody, atmospheric shots. The King's Gate offers iconic views.
*   **Temppeliaukio Church:** Use a wide-angle lens for the interior to capture the copper dome and rock walls. Focus on the interplay of natural light.
*   **Uspenski Cathedral:** Capture the red brick and golden domes from the Market Square across the harbor, especially at sunset.
*   **Esplanadi Park:** Utilize the long, tree-lined perspective. Winter snow offers stark, beautiful contrasts.

### **Equipment Recommendations**
*   **Wide-angle lens:** Essential for capturing the grandeur of cathedrals and large open spaces like Senate Square.
*   **Standard zoom lens (24-70mm equivalent):** Versatile for most shots, including street photography and market interiors.
*   **Tripod:** Recommended for low-light shots (e.g., inside churches at dusk, cityscapes at night) and for capturing long exposures.
*   **Extra batteries:** Especially in winter, cold weather drains batteries quickly.

### **Timing and Lighting Advice**
*   **Golden Hour:** The hour after sunrise and before sunset provides warm, soft light, perfect for architectural details and cityscapes.
*   **Blue Hour:** The period just after sunset (or before sunrise) when the sky turns a deep blue. Ideal for city lights against a dramatic sky.
*   **Overcast Days:** Soft, diffused light, perfect for even architectural photography without harsh shadows. Good for interior shots.

### **Respectful Photography Guidelines**
*   **Churches & Chapels:** Be respectful of worshippers and silence requirements. Avoid flash photography. Some places may prohibit photography during services.
*   **People:** Always ask permission before photographing individuals, especially in markets or more intimate settings.
