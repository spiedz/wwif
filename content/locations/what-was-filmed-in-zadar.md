**Filming Connection:** Though not explicitly stated in specific scene details, the futuristic and artistic nature of these installations makes them ideal for science fiction or contemporary thrillers. It is plausible that the unique light display of the Greeting to the Sun could have inspired a visual used in [*Star Wars: The Last Jedi*](/film/star-wars-the-last-jedi), given its reported association with the nearby Pleso Air Base's "futuristic" aesthetic.

**What You'll See:** Imposing Venetian defensive walls and the beautifully preserved Land Gate, a grand entrance to the Old Town featuring intricate carvings.
**Filming Connection:** The impressive Land Gate and ancient city walls would be prime candidates for any historical drama, especially those involving entry or siege scenes. Given its historical accuracy and grandeur, it aligns with locations used for medieval-fantasy series such as elements within [*Game of Thrones*](/tv/game-of-thrones) or the setting for a chase sequence in shows like [*Strike Back*](/tv/strike-back).
