## üó∫Ô∏è Top Plitvice Filming Locations to Explore

The dramatic landscapes of Plitvice Lakes National Park provided an ideal setting for the Western adventures of Winnetou. Here are some of the most recognizable filming locations you can visit:

### 1. **Veliki Slap (The Great Waterfall)**
**What You'll See:** The majestic Veliki Slap, the tallest waterfall in Croatia, was a prominent feature in several *Winnetou* films. Its sheer power and scale provided a dramatic backdrop for many scenes, often representing the untouched wilderness where the protagonists found solace or faced peril. You can approach the base of the falls for an impressive perspective.
**Connection to Films:** Reportedly featured in wide shots and as a pivotal backdrop in climactic scenes in films like [*The Treasure of Silver Lake* (1962)](/films/where-was-the-treasure-of-silver-lake-filmed) and *Winnetou I*.
**Photography Tips:** Best photographed from the viewing platform at its base, or from above on the trails leading down to the Lower Lakes. Use a wide-angle lens to capture its grandeur.
**Access:** Easily accessible via well-marked paths within the Lower Lakes section of the park.

*Wooden boardwalk winding through the turquoise lakes of Plitvice Lakes National Park, surrounded by lush greenery.*

### 2. **Lower Lakes & Wooden Boardwalks**
**What You'll See:** The iconic wooden boardwalks winding over and around the turquoise lakes of the Lower Lakes system were frequently used for tracking shots and establishing wide-angle scenes of the protagonists traversing the wild landscape. The vibrant colors of the water and the lush surrounding greenery are instantly recognizable.
**Connection to Films:** These picturesque paths and the breathtaking lake system often represented the unspoiled territories that Winnetou and his companions explored. Scenes involving horseback riding (though not directly on the boardwalks) would have used these general areas. Seen throughout the early *Winnetou* films, including [*Winnetou I* (1963)](/films/where-was-winnetou-i-filmed).
**Photography Tips:** Capture the winding paths leading into the distance, especially early morning or late afternoon for soft light and fewer people.
**Access:** The main visitor routes for the Lower Lakes lead you directly through these areas.

### 3. **The Upper Lakes**
**What You'll See:** The Upper Lakes, characterized by larger, deeper lakes and more dense forestation, provided the perfect setting for scenes requiring a sense of deep wilderness and untamed nature. Areas with cascading series of smaller waterfalls and calmer waters would have been ideal for less action-oriented, more reflective moments in the movies.
**Connection to Films:** These areas reportedly served as generic "wilderness" or "Native American territory" in the films, providing natural, unspoiled backdrops for tracking shots and establishing a sense of the vast American West. Featured in background shots of films like [*Winnetou II* (1964)](/films/where-was-winnetou-ii-filmed) and [*Old Surehand* (1965)](/films/where-was-old-surehand-filmed).
**Photography Tips:** Find elevated viewpoints for panoramic shots, or focus on the intricate details of smaller waterfalls and reflective pools.
**Access:** Explore via a combination of walking paths, electric boat rides across Kozjak Lake, and the panoramic park train.

*Panoramic view of the Upper Lakes of Plitvice Lakes National Park from a high viewpoint, showing numerous interconnected lakes and waterfalls.*

### 4. **Barac Caves (Baraƒáeve ≈°pilje) - Nearby Filming Location**
**What You'll See:** Though not directly within the national park boundaries, the nearby Barac Caves played a significant role in the *Winnetou* films, often used to depict hidden entrances to treasures or secret hideouts. These ancient caves, filled with stalactites and stalagmites, offer a glimpse into the underground world that would have added mystery and intrigue to the film's narratives.
**Connection to Films:** The caves reportedly served as the interior filming locations for various hideouts and mysterious caverns in films such as [*The Treasure of Silver Lake* (1962)](/films/where-was-the-treasure-of-silver-lake-filmed), where the famed "Silver Lake" (and its hidden treasure) was a central plot point.
**Photography Tips:** Tripods are often not allowed due to space constraints, but experiment with long exposures if possible (check rules with guide). The soft lighting creates dramatic silhouettes.
**Access:** Located about 20 minutes drive east of Plitvice Lakes National Park. Guided tours run regularly.

### **General Photography Tips**
- **Timing:** Early morning (park opening) or late afternoon provides softer light, fewer crowds, and stunning reflections on the water.
- **Filters:** A circular polarizer can enhance water colors and reduce glare. A neutral density (ND) filter can create dreamy long exposures of the waterfalls.
- **Equipment:** A wide-angle lens is essential for landscapes, but don't forget a zoom lens for details and wildlife. Consider a small, lightweight tripod for low light, although often not practical on crowded boardwalks.
- **Rainy Days:** Often offer the most vibrant water colors and lush greenery. Don't let rain deter you!
