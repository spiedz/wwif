*   **Picnics on the Beach:** Grab some local produce from Mercado de la Bretxa and enjoy a picnic on La Concha Beach, particularly scenic at sunset.

### Safety Considerations
*   San Sebastian is a very safe city, but like any tourist destination, be aware of pickpockets, especially in crowded areas like the Parte Vieja or on public transport.
*   The ocean can have strong currents, so be mindful of warning flags on the beaches.
*   When hiking Monte Urgull, wear comfortable shoes as paths can be uneven.

### Cultural Etiquette
*   **Pintxos Bars:** It's common to stand at the bar. Don't be shy; order directly from the bar staff. Some bars have 'honor systems' where you tally your own pintxos and pay at the end.
*   **Basque Language:** While Spanish is universally spoken, learning a few Basque phrases like "Kaixo" (hello), "Eskerrik asko" (thank you), and "Agur" (goodbye) is appreciated.
*   **Siesta:** While less prevalent in the bustling tourist areas, some smaller shops may close for a few hours in the early afternoon, especially outside the peak season.

### Hidden Gems & Local Secrets
*   **Pasai Donibane (San Juan):** A picturesque fishing village across the bay from San Sebastian, accessible by a short boat ride from Pasai San Pedro. Wander its narrow streets and enjoy fresh seafood.
*   **Cementerio de Polloe:** An unexpectedly beautiful cemetery on a hillside offering peaceful walks and impressive sculptures, with views of the surrounding hills.
*   **Tabakalera - International Centre for Contemporary Culture:** A former tobacco factory turned cultural hub, featuring art exhibitions, a cinema, and a vibrant atmosphere.
