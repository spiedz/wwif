*   **Hidden Gems & Local Secrets:**
    *   **Quadrilatero Romano:** Explore the charming narrow streets of this ancient Roman grid, now filled with trendy bars, boutique shops, and traditional eateries.
    *   **Galleria Subalpina:** A beautiful 19th-century shopping arcade, reminiscent of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, perfect for a refined passeggiata (stroll) and a coffee.
    *   **Parco Dora:** A fascinating example of industrial archaeology transformed into an urban park, offering a unique, almost dystopian feel perfect for alternative photography.
    *   **Murazzi del Po:** The riverside area along the Po, historically industrial, now home to lively bars and clubs. Great for evening strolls and enjoying the river atmosphere.
