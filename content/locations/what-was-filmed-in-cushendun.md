Its rugged landscape, quaint structures, and unique geological features provide the perfect natural backdrop for the epic tales told in **HBO's globally acclaimed series [*Game of Thrones*](/tv-shows/where-was-game-of-thrones-filmed)** and Robert Eggers' Viking saga, **[*The Northman* (2022)](/films/where-was-the-northman-filmed)**. Prepare to be transported to another realm as you explore the very spots where cinematic magic unfolded.

## ‚ú® Why Visit This Cinematic Location?

Cushendun stands out as a unique film tourism destination due to its incredible natural beauty combined with its authentic village charm. It‚Äôs a place that truly allows you to immerse yourself in the world of your beloved films and shows, offering a tangible connection to the stories.

### üé• Film & TV Legacy: Where Fantasy Meets Reality
The most famous filming location here is undoubtedly the **Cushendun Caves**, reportedly used in *Game of Thrones*. Fans will instantly recognise these ancient formations as the ominous spot in the Stormlands where Melisandre gave birth to the shadow baby in Season 2. Stepping into the caves evokes an eerie, powerful atmosphere, making it a truly immersive experience for fans. Beyond Westeros, the broader **Cushendun area** was reportedly transformed into a Viking village for scenes in *The Northman (2022)*, starring Alexander Skarsg√•rd and Nicole Kidman, capitalising on the raw, untamed beauty of the coastline and estuary for its historical setting.

### üì∏ Visual Appeal & Photography Opportunities
From the dramatic, wave-sculpted caves to the charming, Cornish-style cottages, Cushendun is a photographer's dream. The village boasts a unique architectural style, distinct from other parts of Northern Ireland, with its cluster of whitewashed, slate-roofed homes built by Clough Williams-Ellis, the architect behind Portmeirion.

## üìç Top Must-Visit Filming Locations

Cushendun offers a compact yet incredibly impactful set of filming locations, allowing visitors to relive iconic movie moments with ease.

### 1. üêâ Cushendun Caves ‚Äì Game of Thrones' Shadow Baby Birth Site

**What You'll See:** These ancient, naturally formed sea caves are dark, atmospheric, and incredibly dramatic. They are carved out of 400-million-year-old Slate and Schist rock by extreme weather conditions.
**The Scene:** Fans will immediately recognize the caves as the treacherous spot on the Stormlands coast where Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham) was reluctantly forced to bring Melisandre (Carice van Houten) ashore, witnessing her give birth to the terrifying shadow baby in Season 2, Episode 4, "Garden of Bones," from [*Game of Thrones*](/tv-shows/where-was-game-of-thrones-filmed).
**Photography Tips:** Bring a wide-angle lens to capture the scale of the cave mouths. Low-light conditions inside the caves mean a tripod or good camera stabilisation is beneficial. Try a long exposure for a dramatic effect if you can. Best visited at low tide for easier access and exploration.
**Access & Guidelines:** The caves are freely accessible and are a short, signposted walk from the main village car park, across a small footbridge. Access may be difficult or impossible at high tide, so check tide times locally. Wear non-slip footwear as the rocks can be wet.

### 2. ü™ì Cushendun Beach & Estuary ‚Äì The Northman's Viking Village

**What You'll See:** A stunning sandy beach where the River Dun meets the sea, backed by rolling green hills. This area provides a wide, open expanse with a natural, ancient feel.
**The Scene:** The picturesque **Cushendun area**, including its coastal stretches and potentially the beach and estuary, was reportedly transformed into a raw, authentic Viking village for key scenes in the epic historical thriller [*The Northman* (2022)](/films/where-was-the-northman-filmed). Its rugged, elemental beauty perfectly suited the film's gritty aesthetic. While specific sets are no longer present, the landscape itself evokes the film's powerful atmosphere.
**Photography Tips:** Capture the sweeping views of the bay and the river's mouth. Early morning or late afternoon light casts a beautiful glow over the hills and water. Focus on the natural lines of the beach and the distant views for powerful landscape shots.
**Access & Guidelines:** The beach and estuary are easily accessible from the village. There is ample parking nearby, and a short walk takes you directly onto the sand. This is a public area perfect for a leisurely stroll or a picnic.

### 3. üè° Maud‚Äôs Cottages & Village Charm

**What You'll See:** The distinctive Cornish-style whitewashed cottages that define Cushendun's unique character. These National Trust owned properties add immense charm to the village.
**The Scene:** While not explicitly a filming location for *Game of Thrones* or *The Northman*, the overall aesthetic of **Cushendun village**, particularly these charming cottages, contributes to the 'storybook' feel that makes it an attractive setting for productions. The village streets and surrounding areas were likely surveyed and used for wider shots providing context for *The Northman*'s "Viking village" setting, showcasing the raw, untouched beauty of the region.
**Photography Tips:** Capture the quaintness of the cottages against the green hills. Focus on architectural details or charming streetscapes. The stone bridge over the River Dun also offers lovely photo opportunities.
**Access & Guidelines:** The cottages are residential, so please respect local privacy. They can be admired from the public pathways and streets. The stone bridge is publicly accessible.
