*   **Sun Protection:** The Croatian sun can be intense. Wear hats, sunglasses, and high SPF sunscreen, especially when walking the city walls.
*   **Footwear:** Dubrovnik's Old Town is full of polished limestone and steep stairs. Wear comfortable, non-slip shoes to avoid falls.

### **Cultural Etiquette**
*   **Dress Code:** While Dubrovnik is largely casual, dress respectfully when visiting churches or religious sites.
*   **Greetings:** A simple "Dobar dan" (good day) goes a long way. Croatians are generally very welcoming.
*   **Tipping:** Tipping 10-15% in restaurants is appreciated if service is good. For cafes, rounding up to the nearest Euro is common.

### **Hidden Gems & Local Secrets**
*   **Bu≈æa Bar:** Nested into the cliffside just outside the city walls, this "hole-in-the-wall" bar offers spectacular sunset views and a chance for cliff jumping into the Adriatic. Look for the "cold drinks" sign.
*   **Wander away from the Stradun:** The true charm of Dubrovnik lies in its labyrinthine backstreets, often used for subtle *Game of Thrones* scenes. Get lost!
*   **Early Morning Market:** Visit Gunduliƒáeva Poljana market early for fresh local produce, olive oil, and spirits, a quieter, more authentic experience.
