- **Telephoto lens:** Useful for detailed architectural shots, distant views from towers, or capturing candid moments in busy markets.
- **Tripod:** For night photography (State Opera, Ferris Wheel lights) or long exposure shots.
- **Circular Polarizer filter:** To reduce glare on reflective surfaces (ponds at Belvedere) and enhance sky colors.

### **Timing & Lighting Advice:**
- **Golden Hour (Sunrise & Sunset):** The best time for warm, soft light, perfect for palaces and grand buildings. Head to the Gloriette at Sch√∂nbrunn, or the South Tower of St. Stephen's Cathedral.
- **Blue Hour (Just after sunset):** Ideal for cityscapes when artificial lights begin to glow, offering a magical contrast with the deepening blue sky (e.g., State Opera, city views from Prater).
- **Early Morning:** To avoid crowds at popular locations (Sch√∂nbrunn, St. Stephen's Cathedral).
- **Overcast Days:** Can provide soft, even lighting, excellent for detailed architectural shots without harsh shadows.

### **Respectful Photography Guidelines:**
- **Inside Museums/Palaces:** Always check if photography is allowed, and if flash photography is prohibited. Respect signs.
- **People:** Be mindful and respectful when photographing locals. Ask permission if taking close-up portraits.
- **Privacy:** Avoid photographing private homes or individuals without their consent.
