## üåü Insider Tips for Your Budva Film Tourism Adventure

Gain local insights to make your trip smoother, more enjoyable, and more authentic.

### **Money-Saving Suggestions**
- **Eat Local:** Opt for konobas (traditional taverns) slightly away from the main tourist hubs for better value and authenticity. Look for fixed-price daily menus (dnevni menu).
- **Public Transport:** Use local buses for trips to nearby beaches or Sveti Stefan (‚Ç¨1-‚Ç¨2 per ride) instead of constant taxis.
- **Picnic:** Buy fresh produce from the local market (Pijaca) and make your own lunches for beach days.
- **Avoid Peak Season:** Traveling in the shoulder season (May, June, September, October) can significantly reduce accommodation and flight costs.
- **Cash is King:** While cards are widely accepted, having small euro denominations for smaller purchases, local buses, or cafes is convenient.

### **Safety Considerations**
- **Sun Protection:** The Montenegrin sun can be intense, especially in summer. Use high SPF sunscreen, wear hats, and stay hydrated.
- **Footwear:** Cobblestone streets in Old Town and paths to beaches like Mogren can be uneven. Wear comfortable, sturdy shoes.
- **Taxi Fares:** Always negotiate the fare before getting into a taxi, or insist on the meter (though this is rare). Ride-hailing apps are less common but look for local alternatives if available.
- **Valuables:** Be mindful of your belongings in crowded tourist areas, just as you would in any city.

### **Cultural Etiquette**
- **Greetings:** A simple "Zdravo" (hello) or "Dobar dan" (good day) goes a long way.
- **Coffee Culture:** Montenegrins enjoy long, leisurely coffee breaks. Don't expect speedy service in cafes; relax and enjoy the pace.
- **Dress Code:** While Budva is a beach resort, dress modestly when visiting churches or religious sites.
- **Tipping:** Tipping is appreciated, usually 10% in restaurants for good service. Rounding up taxi fares is common.

### **Hidden Gems & Local Secrets**
- **Walk the Old Town Walls:** For a small fee (approx. ‚Ç¨2.50), you can walk along parts of the Old Town walls, offering unique perspectives.
- **Richard's Head Beach:** Located just outside the Old Town walls, this small beach offers stunning views of the Old Town itself.
- **Explore Lesser-Known Beaches:** While Mogren is famous, seek out other beautiful, less crowded beaches on the Budva Riviera by taking local buses or boat tours.
- **Visit during the morning fish market:** Near the marina, early mornings offer a glimpse into local life as fishermen bring in their catch.
