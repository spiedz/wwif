### 5. **Kazimierz (Jewish Quarter)**

<img src="https://images.musement.com/cover/0144/65/thumb_14364712_cover_header.jpeg" alt="Krakow: A narrow, cobbled street in the Kazimierz Jewish Quarter, lined with historic buildings and cafes." style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;" />

**Filming Connection:** Kazimierz was the principal filming location for much of *Schindler's List* (reportedly used as a stand-in for the former Krakow Ghetto, as the original ghetto area was largely modernized). Its authentic, pre-war atmosphere made it ideal for recreating the Jewish district. Many of the harrowing scenes showing the forced relocation and life within the ghetto were filmed here, particularly around Szeroka Street and Joseph Street.

**What You'll See:** A vibrant historic district, once Krakow's Jewish Quarter, filled with synagogues, Jewish cemeteries, charming cafes, and art galleries. Its narrow, cobbled streets retain a unique atmosphere.
**Best Photo Spots:** Szeroka Street, Plac Nowy, and the numerous atmospheric side alleys.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Barbakan_Krakow_z_ulicy_Basztowej.jpg" alt="Krakow: The Barbican, a circular brick defensive structure with turrets, standing against a blue sky." style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;" />

**Filming Connection:** The Barbican, a rare surviving example of medieval fortification, offers a strong visual anchor to Krakow's history. Films requiring shots of medieval or historically significant architecture that is well-preserved, such as establishing shots in *Cold War* or for historical context in other productions, might use the Barbican to set the scene.

**What You'll See:** A circular brick defensive outpost and one of the finest surviving examples of medieval military architecture in Europe. Part of the old city fortifications.
**Best Photo Spots:** From the outside, capturing its impressive circular structure.
**Access:** Open seasonally (usually April-October), c. 10 PLN.

### 8. **Collegium Maius (Jagiellonian University)**

**Filming Connection:** The historic Collegium Maius, with its atmospheric courtyard and centuries-old academic feel, can lend itself to scenes requiring an old-world European university setting. For a film like [*The Reader*](/films/where-was-the-reader-filmed) (partially set in a post-war Germany and with a storyline involving academia), a location like Collegium Maius could have provided a suitable stand-in for European university architecture. Reports indicate some scenes for *Youth* were also filmed in Krakow, and this timeless academic setting could have been utilized.

**What You'll See:** The oldest building of the Jagiellonian University, featuring a beautiful Gothic courtyard with arcades and a historical well. It houses a museum of the university's history.
**Best Photo Spots:** The interior courtyard is exceptionally photogenic.
