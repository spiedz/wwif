-   **Milk Bars (Bary Mleczne):** For extremely budget-friendly and authentic Polish meals, seek out these cafeteria-style eateries like "Bar Mleczny Neptun" near the Long Market.
-   **Free Walking Tours:** Many companies offer free walking tours (tip-based) focusing on the Old Town's history, which cover many film-related locations and provide great context.

### **Safety Considerations:**
-   **General Safety:** Gdansk is a safe city. However, like any tourist destination, be aware of pickpockets in crowded areas (e.g., Long Market, during St. Dominic's Fair) and on public transport.
-   **Nightlife:** Stick to well-lit, populated areas in the Old Town at night.
-   **River Safety:** If taking a river cruise, ensure you follow all safety instructions.

### **Cultural Etiquette:**
-   **Service Charges:** Tipping 10-15% in restaurants is customary if service is good.
