Embark on your cinematic journey through Rome, visiting these famous landmarks that have graced the silver screen.

### 1. The Colosseum & Roman Forum üèõÔ∏è
While much of *Gladiator* was filmed on sets, the spiritual and historical significance of the Colosseum as the heart of Roman spectacle is undeniable. The real Colosseum and adjacent Roman Forum evoke the grandeur and power of the empire, inspiring many cinematic interpretations.
