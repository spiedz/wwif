            <p>Capture the magic of Larne's cinematic landscapes with these photography tips:</p>

            <h3>Best Shots & Instagram-Worthy Spots:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carnlough Harbour:</strong> Recreate the 'Arya scene' on the stone steps. Capture the colourful boats and the picturesque bridge.</li>
                <li><strong>Mounthill:</strong> Frame wide-angle shots of the expansive, rolling hills to convey the 'Kingsroad's' epic scale.</li>
                <li><strong>Glenarm Estate:</strong> Focus on the vibrant Walled Garden for bursts of colour. Photograph the castle's unique architecture both close-up and within its broad landscape context.</li>
                <li><strong>Antrim Plateau:</strong> Embrace the wild, rugged beauty. Look for leading lines in the terrain and use the dramatic skies. Early morning or late afternoon light will enhance textures and create long shadows.</li>
                <li><strong>Coastline:</strong> The Chaine Memorial Tower at Larne Lough entrance and the Antrim Coast Road offer stunning sea views and dramatic cliff backdrops.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Equipment Recommendations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wide-Angle Lens:</strong> Essential for capturing the vastness of the Antrim Plateau and coastal views.</li>
                <li><strong>Standard Zoom Lens:</strong> Versatile for most scenes, including harbour views and castle details.</li>
                <li><strong>Tripod:</strong> Useful for low-light photography (sunrise/sunset), long exposures of water, and for sharp landscape shots.</li>
                <li><strong>Rain Cover/Weatherproofing:</strong> Northern Ireland weather is unpredictable; protect your gear!</li>
                <li><strong>Spare Batteries & Memory Cards:</strong> You don't want to miss a shot.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Timing & Lighting Advice:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Golden Hour (Sunrise & Sunset):</strong> The warm, soft light is ideal for landscapes, creating beautiful colours and long shadows that add depth.</li>
                <li><strong>Overcast Days:</strong> Paradoxically, soft, diffused light on overcast days can be excellent for photography, reducing harsh shadows and bringing out the lush greens of the landscape.</li>
                <li><strong>Blue Hour:</strong> Just after sunset or before sunrise, when the sky is a deep blue, can create a magical atmosphere.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Respectful Photography Guidelines:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Private Property:</strong> Always be mindful and respect private property boundaries, especially around Mounthill and parts of the Antrim Plateau.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Do not venture onto unsafe cliffs or private land just for a photo. Your safety is paramount.</li>
                <li><strong>Leave No Trace:</strong> Pack out everything you pack in. Preserve the natural beauty for future visitors.</li>
            </ul>
