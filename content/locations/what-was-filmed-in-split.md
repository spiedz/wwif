## ‚ú® Why Visit Split for its Film Legacy?

Split's appeal as a film destination goes beyond its stunning aesthetics. The city offers a unique blend of accessibility, vibrant culture, and a rich history that resonates deeply with the narratives it helps tell on screen.

### üêâ **Step into Westeros**
For legions of fans, Split is synonymous with Meereen and King's Landing from HBO's *Game of Thrones*. The labyrinthine halls of Diocletian's Palace perfectly embodied the exotic, ancient cities of Essos. Walking through these very walls, you can almost hear the dragons roar or envision the Unsullied marching. The level of detail and preservation of these ancient sites allowed the show to create a world that felt incredibly real, drawing millions of viewers worldwide.

### üé¨ **Beyond the Seven Kingdoms**
While *Game of Thrones* put Split on the global film tourism map, it's not the only production to recognize the city's cinematic potential. Reportedly, segments of [*The Hitman's Bodyguard*](/films/where-was-the-hitmans-bodyguard-filmed) starring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson utilized Split's dramatic coastal roads and urban landscapes for high-stakes action. This diversity in filmed genres highlights Split's ability to adapt to various storytelling needs, from period dramas to modern thrillers.

### üì∏ **A Photographer's Dream**
With its ancient ruins, bustling Riva promenade, and stunning views from Marjan Hill, Split is a visual feast. Every corner offers an opportunity for a breathtaking shot, whether you're capturing the play of light on Roman stones or the vibrant life of the city against the Adriatic Sea. For film fans, recreating iconic scenes or simply absorbing the atmosphere that inspired filmmakers is a unique experience.

## üèõÔ∏è Top Must-Visit Filming Locations in Split

Split's cinematic heart lies primarily within the magnificent **Diocletian's Palace**, a UNESCO World Heritage site and a living museum. While other areas of the city have also been used, the palace complex is where the magic truly comes alive for film fans.

### 1. **Diocletian's Palace Cellars (Substructures)** - Meereen's Dragon Kennels üêâ

**What You'll See:** These ancient, dimly lit cellars served as the perfect eerie backdrop for Daenerys Targaryen's dragon kennels in *Game of Thrones* season 4 and 5. Remember the scene where Daenerys chains her dragons Viserion and Rhaegal, and later when Tyrion Lannister attempts to free them? This is where it happened. The raw, ancient stone walls and cool, damp air immediately transport you to Westeros.

**Best Photo Spots:** The long, vaulted corridors offer fantastic photographic opportunities, especially playing with shadows and light. Try to capture the scale of the chambers.

**Access Information:** The cellars are open to the public for a fee (approx. ‚Ç¨7-10). They are easily accessible from the Peristyle Square.
**Visitor Guidelines:** Guided tours are available, which often include insights into the filming. Keep an eye out for tour guides specializing in *Game of Thrones*.

### 2. **Peristyle Square** - King's Landing & Imperial Meetings üëë

**What You'll See:** The central square of Diocletian's Palace, flanked by ancient columns and architectural splendor. While most famously used as a general atmospheric shot for "King's Landing," it also served as the backdrop for various walk-and-talk scenes. The grandeur of the square, with the Cathedral of St. Domnius bell tower towering above, makes it instantly recognizable as a place of power and history.

**Best Photo Spots:** Capture the full fa√ßade of the Cathedral, the Egyptian sphinx, and the Roman columns. Early morning or late evening provides beautiful light and fewer crowds.

**Access Information:** Free to enter, as it's a public square within the palace.
**Visitor Guidelines:** The square is often busy with street performers and cafes. Find a quiet corner to soak in the atmosphere.

### 3. **The Golden Gate (Porta Aurea)** - Meereen's Gate & Escape Routes ‚öîÔ∏è

**What You'll See:** The impressive northern entrance to Diocletian's Palace. Reportedly, this gate and the adjacent street were used for scenes depicting the outer walls of Meereen or other parts of Essos. Imagine the Sons of the Harpy lurking or Unsullied marching through this grand archway.

**Best Photo Spots:** Stand just outside the gate to capture its full majesty. The light is often beautiful in the late afternoon.

**Access Information:** Free to access, as it's part of the public palace complex.
**Visitor Guidelines:** This area can be a gathering point for tours, so patience is key for clear shots.

### 4. **Narrow Alleyways within Diocletian's Palace** - Meereen's Labyrinthine Streets üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**What You'll See:** The countless twisting, narrow cobblestone alleys within the palace walls. These atmospheric streets, lined with ancient stone buildings and small shops, were frequently used to represent the intricate and often dangerous streets of Meereen. You can envision characters like Jorah Mormont and Tyrion Lannister navigating these very paths.

**Best Photo Spots:** Look for unique archways, charming courtyards, and unexpected glimpses of local life. The play of light and shadow in these alleys is perfect for moody, atmospheric shots.

**Access Information:** Free to explore. Many lead to hidden cafes and unique shops.
**Visitor Guidelines:** Many parts of the palace are residential, so be mindful of local residents and keep noise levels down.

### 5. **Bell Tower of the Cathedral of Saint Domnius** - Panoramic Views of the Kingdom üè∞

<img src="https://www.eggandbacon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cathedral-of-Saint-Domnius-Split-jpg.webp" alt="Split, Croatia: The Bell Tower of the Cathedral of Saint Domnius towering above Roman ruins" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;" />

**What You'll See:** While not explicitly a "filming location" for a specific scene, the iconic Bell Tower offers panoramic views over Diocletian's Palace and the city of Split, providing the perfect context for the sprawling fictional cities. From here, you can truly appreciate the scale of the ancient city that served as a backdrop and imagine the entire "kingdom" below.

**Best Photo Spots:** Capture the stunning 360-degree views, especially at sunset, showcasing the red rooftops, the Adriatic Sea, and the surrounding mountains.

**Access Information:** Requires a separate entrance fee (approx. ‚Ç¨5-7) to climb the tower. The climb is steep and narrow, but the views are worth it.
**Visitor Guidelines:** Not suitable for those with mobility issues or severe vertigo.
