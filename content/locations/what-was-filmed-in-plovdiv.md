## üí° Insider Tips for Your Plovdiv Film Journey

Make your film tourism experience in Plovdiv even more enriching with these local insights.

### **Money-Saving Suggestions:**
-   **Bulgarian Lev (BGN):** While some places accept Euros, the local currency is recommended. Exchange money at reputable exchange offices (change bureaus) rather than the airport. ATMs are widely available.
-   **Free Walking Tours:** Look for free walking tours that often start at the Roman Stadium. These are a great way to get an overview of the main sites, including some filming locations, and get insider tips from local guides who might share anecdotal stories about film crews.
-   **Eat Locally:** Avoid tourist traps right next to major attractions. Venture a few streets away or into Kapana for better value and more authentic Bulgarian food. Look for "Kushtata" (house) style restaurants for traditional home cooking.

### **Safety Considerations:**
-   Plovdiv is generally very safe for tourists. As with any popular destination, be aware of pickpockets in crowded areas like markets or bus stations.
-   The cobblestone streets in the Old Town can be slippery when wet and are steep in places; wear appropriate footwear.
-   When taking taxis, ensure the driver uses the meter or agree on a price beforehand to avoid overcharging.

### **Cultural Etiquette:**
-   **Head Nodding:** In Bulgaria, a single nod of the head means "no," and shaking the head from side to side means "yes." This can be confusing! Rely on verbal cues if unsure.
-   **Hospitality:** Bulgarians are generally warm and hospitable. A simple "Blagodarya" (thank you) goes a long way.
-   **Dress Code:** When visiting religious sites (like Dzhumaya Mosque or churches), dress modestly (shoulders and knees covered).

### **Hidden Gems & Local Secrets:**
-   **Small Galleries in the Old Town:** Beyond the major museums, many smaller art galleries in the Old Town are housed in charming Revival-era buildings. Pop in for unique local art.
-   **Hissar Kapiya:** This ancient gate in the Old Town offers unique photo opportunities and often has local artists or musicians nearby. It's a quieter spot than the Roman Theatre.
-   **Creative Spaces in Kapana:** Explore the side streets of Kapana to discover hidden cafes, artisan workshops, and unique street art installations that might not be on the main tourist paths.
-   **Alyosha Monument:** While a bit of a hike, the Soviet Army monument on Bunardzhik Hill offers another incredible panoramic view of Plovdiv and the surrounding landscape, providing a different perspective for photographers.
