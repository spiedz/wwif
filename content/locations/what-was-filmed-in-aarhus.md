*   **Tipping Culture:** Tipping is not mandatory in Denmark, as service charges are included in prices. However, rounding up the bill or leaving a small tip (5-10%) for exceptional service in restaurants or cafes is appreciated but not expected.
*   **Cash vs. Card:** Denmark is largely cashless. Cards are widely accepted everywhere, even for small purchases. It's rare to need cash.
*   **Danish 'Hygge':** Embrace the concept of 'hygge' (pronounced 'hoo-gah'), which encapsulates coziness, comfort, and conviviality. Seek out cozy cafes, enjoy a warm drink, and savor moments of contentedness.
*   **Public Toilets:** Public toilets are generally available at train stations, shopping centers, and museums, often with a small fee (approx. 5-10 DKK).
*   **Emergency Numbers:** Dial 112 for all emergencies (police, fire, ambulance) throughout Denmark.
*   **Language:** Danes have an excellent command of English, so communication won't be an issue for most travelers.
*   **Exploring on Foot & Bike:** Aarhus is a very walkable and bikeable city. Many of the key locations listed are best explored on foot or by bicycle, allowing you to discover hidden gems along the way.
*   **Check Opening Hours:** Always double-check opening hours for museums and attractions, especially during public holidays or the off-season.
*   **Weather Prep:** Danish weather can be unpredictable. Pack layers, including waterproof outer shells, even in summer.
