*   **Križanke Summer Theatre:** An atmospheric former monastery complex, redesigned by Plečnik, that hosts open-air performances. Even if not attending a show, peeking into its courtyards is enchanting.
*   **Trnovo Bridge (Plečnik's Bridge):** Another unique bridge by Plečnik, featuring birch trees and statues. Less famous than Triple Bridge, but very charming. Great for a quiet stroll and photography.
*   **Walk up to Šmarna Gora:** For a fantastic panoramic view of Ljubljana and the surrounding Alps, hike up Šmarna Gora hill (about 30-45 minutes uphill). There’s a charming church and a restaurant at the top.
*   **Metelkova Art Center:** A vibrant, autonomous cultural center transformed from former military barracks, filled with colourful murals, sculptures, and alternative bars. A stark contrast to the historical center, but a fascinating glimpse into Ljubljana's bohemian side. Good for evening exploration if you're into alternative culture.
