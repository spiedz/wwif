One of the largest and oldest marketplaces in the Balkans, the Skopje Old Bazaar is a labyrinth of cobbled streets, artisan shops, and traditional eateries.

The grand Macedonia Square, dominated by the colossal "Warrior on Horse" statue (Alexander the Great), and surrounded by neo-classical buildings, represents modern Skopje.

Porta Macedonia, a grand triumphal arch commemorating Macedonian independence, features intricate carvings and statues. It provides a striking, modern historical backdrop that could be used for opening or closing scenes in films dealing with national identity or historical moments, perhaps offering a contemporary counterpoint to the ancient settings in films like [*Before the Rain* (1994)](/films/where-was-before-the-rain-filmed).

Standing majestically atop Vodno Mountain, the Millennium Cross offers breathtaking panoramic views of Skopje and the surrounding landscape. Its dramatic height and isolation make it an ideal location for contemplative scenes, climactic moments, or establishing shots, potentially for films like [*The Mountain* (2018)](/films/where-was-the-mountain-filmed) for its sheer scale.

Just a short drive from Skopje, Matka Canyon is a natural wonder featuring a stunning river flowing through steep cliffs, surrounded by ancient monasteries and caves. This picturesque location could be a serene, dramatic, or even mysterious setting, perfect for scenes involving natural beauty or hidden discoveries, perhaps providing a contrasting natural setting to the urban environments in films like [*Shadows* (2007)](/films/where-was-shadows-filmed).

Nestled in the village of Gorno Nerezi, just outside Skopje, the Church of St. Panteleimon is renowned for its exceptional 12th-century Byzantine frescoes. The church's serene and historically rich interior could feature prominently in scenes requiring religious or historical depth, perhaps for an atmospheric scene in [*The Great Water* (2004)](/films/where-was-the-great-water-filmed) or a meditative moment in [*Before the Rain* (1994)](/films/where-was-before-the-rain-filmed).
