### üé• Film & TV Legacy: From Westeros to West Belfast
Belfast has played a pivotal role in some of the biggest television productions of our time. The city's **Titanic Studios** became the main production hub for HBO's epic fantasy series [*Game of Thrones*](/tv-shows/where-was-game-of-thrones-filmed), hosting numerous indoor sets and serving as a base for cast and crew exploring locations across Northern Ireland. Fans flock to the city to soak in the atmosphere and visit related attractions.

Beyond fantasy, Belfast's authentic urban landscapes have been central to acclaimed dramas. The city's streets were the backdrop for the gripping BBC crime series [*The Fall*](/tv-shows/where-was-the-fall-filmed), starring Gillian Anderson, and the early seasons of the hugely popular police procedural [*Line of Duty*](/tv-shows/where-was-line-of-duty-filmed). More recently, the city's unique charm featured prominently in the beloved comedy series [*Derry Girls*](/tv-shows/where-was-derry-girls-filmed), with many interior scenes filmed in Belfast studios. Major films like [*Dracula Untold*](/films/where-was-dracula-untold-filmed) have also utilized Belfast's diverse architecture for dramatic scenes.
