    -   Look for 'Menu del Giorno' (Menu of the Day) at trattorias for good value lunches.
-   **Safety Considerations:**
    -   Milan is generally safe, but be mindful of pickpockets, especially in crowded areas (Duomo, Central Station, metro). Keep valuables secure.
    -   At night, stick to well-lit and busy areas.
    -   Be aware of unlicensed taxi drivers; use official white taxis or ride-sharing apps.
-   **Cultural Etiquette:**
    -   Dress codes can be important in Milan. Smart casual is generally good, especially in restaurants and upscale venues.
    -   When entering a church, ensure shoulders and knees are covered.
    -   Politeness is appreciated. A "Buongiorno" (good morning) or "Buonasera" (good evening) and "Grazie" (thank you) go a long way.
    -   Italians often linger over meals; don't expect quick service, especially during peak hours.
-   **Hidden Gems & Local Secrets:**
    -   **San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore:** A "Sistine Chapel" of Milan, with stunning Renaissance frescoes, often overlooked by tourists.
    -   **Pinacoteca Ambrosiana:** Less crowded than Brera, houses a remarkable collection including Leonardo's Codex Atlanticus.
