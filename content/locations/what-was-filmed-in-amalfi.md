*   **Shoulder Season Travel:** As mentioned, visiting in May/early June or September/early October offers better prices and fewer crowds.

### **Safety Considerations**
*   **Coastal Road Caution:** The SS163 is beautiful but winding and often busy. Drive defensively, watch out for scooters, and be mindful of pedestrians.
*   **Pickpocketing:** Be aware in crowded areas, especially around the Duomo and bus stops. Keep valuables secure.
*   **Heat:** In July-August, stay hydrated, use sunscreen, and seek shade during midday.
*   **Steep Terrain:** Many streets and alleys involve stairs. Wear sensible, non-slip shoes.

### **Cultural Etiquette**
*   **Dress Modestly:** When visiting churches and religious sites like the Duomo, ensure shoulders and knees are covered.
*   **"Ciao" is informal:** Use "Buongiorno" (good day) or "Buonasera" (good evening) for formal greetings. "Grazie" for thank you.
*   **Tipping:** Not obligatory, but appreciated. Round up the bill or leave ‚Ç¨5-‚Ç¨10 for good service.
*   **Siesta:** Some smaller shops may close for an afternoon break (approx. 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM).

### **Hidden Gems & Local Secrets**
*   **Valle dei Mulini (Paper Mills Valley):** Beyond the Paper Museum, a hike into this lush valley reveals old paper mills, lemon groves, and refreshing waterfalls. A tranquil escape from the crowds.
*   **Atrani:** Just a 10-minute walk east from Amalfi, this charming, unspoiled fishing village feels like stepping back in time, often overlooked by tourists.
*   **Sunset from a Terrace:** Instead of a busy restaurant, find a quiet spot on a higher terrace (e.g., near Hotel Miramalfi if not staying there, perhaps a casual bar with a view) for a spectacular sunset.
