## üèõÔ∏è Why Visit Baku for Film Tourism?

Baku offers a unique cinematic journey through time. One moment you're in a medieval alley that doubled for Istanbul, and the next you're gazing at futuristic towers that could be from a sci-fi blockbuster.

### **A Star in Spy Thrillers**
Baku‚Äôs most famous Hollywood role was in the James Bond film [*The World Is Not Enough* (1999)](/films/where-was-the-world-is-not-enough-filmed). The city's oil-rich landscapes and grand avenues provided the perfect setting for 007's pursuit of an oil tycoon. Fans can visit the actual areas where Pierce Brosnan‚Äôs Bond navigated a world of intrigue and danger. More recently, the city's modern roads reportedly hosted stunt sequences for the blockbuster [*Fast & Furious 9* (2021)](/films/where-was-fast-and-furious-9-filmed).

### **Architectural Diversity and Visual Appeal**
The city is a photographer's and filmmaker's paradise. The contrast between the ancient, honey-stoned walls of Icherisheher (Old City) and the fluid, futuristic lines of the Heydar Aliyev Center is simply breathtaking. This visual diversity allows Baku to stand in for numerous global locations, from historical European cities to modern metropolises.
