## 🗺️ Major Filming Locations

### Madrid: The Criminal's Hometown

Madrid serves as Berlin's base of operations, where he assembles his crew and plans his elaborate heists. The Spanish capital's blend of historic grandeur and modern energy perfectly captures Berlin's character—sophisticated yet dangerous, cultured yet criminal.

**Gran Vía District:**
- **Key Scenes:** Crew recruitment and initial planning
- **Notable Locations:** Historic theaters and rooftop bars
- **Production Notes:** Filmed during early morning to capture empty streets
- **Character Moments:** Berlin's philosophical monologues about life and crime

**Plaza Mayor:**
This 400-year-old square became a recurring location for public meetings and surveillance evasion. The production used the plaza's multiple exits and tourist crowds to create tension-filled sequences where characters must hide in plain sight.

**Filming Challenges:**
- Coordinating with hundreds of real tourists
- Maintaining period-appropriate signage
- Managing sound in the echo-prone plaza
- Creating believable crowd dynamics

**Retiro Park:**
Madrid's green heart provided contrast to the urban heist planning. The Crystal Palace and rose garden became settings for intimate character moments and secret meetings.

**Why This Works:**
The park's beauty mirrors Berlin's appreciation for aesthetics, while its vast spaces allow for private conversations away from potential surveillance. The production used different seasons to show the passage of time.

### Paris: The City of Light and Larceny

Paris represents Berlin's aspirational criminal lifestyle—a city where art, culture, and crime intersect at the highest levels. The production showcased both tourist Paris and the hidden city known only to locals and criminals.

**Louvre District:**
While not filming inside the museum itself, the production used the surrounding streets and cafés for reconnaissance scenes. The area's mix of tourists and high-end shops provided perfect cover for the crew's activities.

**Production Insights:**
- Night shoots captured the area without crowds
- Drone footage required special aviation permits
- Coordination with museum security even for exterior shots
- Use of long lenses to capture authentic street life

**Latin Quarter:**
The bohemian neighborhood served as the setting for Berlin's romantic subplot. Its narrow streets, bookshops, and bistros created an intimate atmosphere contrasting with the high-stakes heist plot.

**Arc de Triomphe Area:**
The monument and Champs-Élysées provided locations for chase sequences and dramatic confrontations. The production closed sections of the famous avenue for key scenes.

### Hidden Locations: The Criminal Underground

Beyond the tourist landmarks, Berlin showcases the hidden spaces where criminals operate—anonymous warehouses, discrete meeting spots, and safe houses that could exist in any European city.

**Madrid Industrial Areas:**
- Warehouse districts in Villaverde
- Anonymous office buildings in AZCA
- Underground parking structures
- Abandoned factories in the outskirts

**Parisian Suburbs:**
- Saint-Denis warehouse locations
- Belleville safe houses
- Underground tunnels (recreated in studio)
- Industrial areas along the Seine

## 🎬 Behind-the-Scenes Production

### Pedro Alonso's Return as Berlin

Reprising his iconic role, Pedro Alonso faced the challenge of playing a younger version of a character whose death scene he'd already filmed.

**Character Preparation:**
- 3 months of preparation before filming
- Studying the character's established timeline
- Creating new mannerisms for the younger Berlin
- Maintaining continuity with Money Heist

**Alonso's Approach:**
> "Playing Berlin again, but younger, meant finding his hunger, his ambition. In Money Heist, he knew he was dying. Here, he believes he's immortal."

### The Heist Choreography

Creating believable heists required extensive planning and expert consultation.

**Technical Advisors:**
- Former security consultants
- Museum security experts
- Jewelry appraisers
- Art historians

**Filming Heist Scenes:**
- 6 weeks of rehearsal for major heist sequences
- Actual security protocols studied and subverted
- Real locations scouted for authentic vulnerabilities
- Stunt coordinators for physical sequences

### International Production Challenges

Filming across two countries presented unique logistical challenges.

**Coordination Required:**

- Equipment transport between countries
- Language barriers (Spanish/French crews)
- Different filming regulations
- Currency and budget management

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Bilingual assistant directors
- Local crew in each country
- Detailed pre-production planning

## 🎯 Final Thoughts: Living Like Berlin

Berlin transforms two of Europe's most visited cities into a criminal's playground, but the series does more than showcase tourist landmarks. It reveals the hidden corners where ambition meets opportunity, where culture provides cover for crime, and where even thieves can fall in love.

Walking through these locations offers fans a chance to see Madrid and Paris through Berlin's eyes—cities not just of monuments and museums, but of possibilities and perfect crimes. The production's attention to authentic locations means visitors can literally follow in the character's footsteps, from planning sessions in Madrid cafés to reconnaissance walks past Parisian jewelers.

The series reminds us that every great city has multiple personalities: the public face shown to tourists and the secret life known only to locals and those who operate in the shadows. Berlin's genius lies in showing how these worlds intersect, how a criminal can appreciate art while planning to steal it, how romance can bloom even as betrayal is being orchestrated.

Whether you're Team Berlin, Team Professor, or simply fascinated by European cities as cinematic settings, exploring these locations offers a unique perspective on urban spaces as stages for drama. In cities built on centuries of history, Berlin asks: What stories are being written today in these ancient streets?
