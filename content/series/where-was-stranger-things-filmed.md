<SeriesLocationsGuide />

Stranger Things has captivated audiences not just with its compelling storyline and nostalgic 80s references, but also with its atmospheric settings that bring the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana to life. Although the show is set in Indiana, the vast majority of filming takes place in and around Atlanta, Georgia, which has become a major hub for film and television production.

The Georgia filming locations have become tourist attractions in their own right, with fans traveling from around the world to visit spots like downtown Jackson, which serves as downtown Hawkins, or the now-iconic Starcourt Mall. Each season introduces new locations while returning to familiar settings, creating a consistent yet evolving world.

What makes Stranger Things' locations particularly interesting is how they blend authentic 1980s Americana with the supernatural elements of the show. From the eerie government laboratory to the nostalgic arcade and mall settings, each location is carefully chosen and designed to enhance the storytelling and transport viewers back to the 1980s.

The production design team goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure period accuracy, from the storefronts and signage to the products on shelves. Many buildings are completely transformed inside and out to create the perfect backdrop for the supernatural adventures of the show's young heroes.

For visitors to Georgia, following in the footsteps of Eleven, Mike, Dustin, Lucas, and Will has become a popular activity, with several tour companies offering guided experiences of the key filming locations. The show's impact on local tourism demonstrates how powerful location filming can be in creating not just a television series, but a destination.
