# 🏹 Where Was Arrow Filmed? Complete Vancouver Location Guide & Behind-the-Scenes

*Discover how Vancouver transformed into Star City for 8 seasons of Arrow, from Gastown's gritty streets to Coal Harbour's gleaming towers.*

## Introduction: Vancouver Becomes Star City

When Oliver Queen returned from his five-year ordeal on Lian Yu, he didn't actually come home to a fictional Star City—he came to Vancouver, British Columbia. For eight seasons and 170 episodes, Arrow transformed Canada's third-largest city into the DC Universe's grittiest metropolis, showcasing locations that ranged from historic Victorian districts to cutting-edge modern architecture.

The CW's groundbreaking superhero series didn't just launch the Arrowverse; it revolutionized how television could bring comic book worlds to life. By utilizing Vancouver's diverse urban landscape, the production created a believable, lived-in city that became as much a character as Oliver Queen himself. This comprehensive guide takes you through every major filming location, revealing how Vancouver doubled for Star City and sharing the behind-the-scenes secrets that made Arrow a television phenomenon.

Whether you're a devoted fan planning a pilgrimage to these iconic locations or a curious traveler interested in Vancouver's Hollywood North credentials, this guide provides everything you need to walk in the footsteps of the Emerald Archer.

## 🗺️ Major Filming Locations in Vancouver

### Gastown: The Heart of The Glades

Vancouver's historic Gastown district became the show's most frequently used location, perfectly embodying The Glades—Star City's crime-ridden neighborhood where Oliver began his vigilante crusade. The area's Victorian architecture, cobblestone streets, and atmospheric alleyways provided an authentic urban setting that required minimal set dressing.

**What You'll See:**
- The famous Steam Clock, featured in numerous establishing shots
- Blood Alley Square, site of multiple vigilante confrontations
- Water Street's historic buildings, doubling as Glades businesses
- Gaoler's Mews, the narrow alley used for chase sequences

**Key Episodes Filmed Here:**
- **"Pilot" (1x01):** Oliver's first night as the Hood, confronting Adam Hunt's security
- **"The Undertaking" (1x21):** The Glades device activation sequences
- **"Streets of Fire" (2x22):** Slade's army attacks through Gastown streets
- **"Lian Yu" (5x23):** Prometheus's final trap in The Glades

**Visiting Information:**
- **Best Time:** Evening for atmosphere, but daytime for safety and visibility
- **Public Transit:** Waterfront Station (SkyTrain) is a 5-minute walk
- **Must-See Spots:** Steam Clock, Blood Alley, Maple Tree Square
- **Local Tip:** Many restaurants and shops embrace their Arrow connection

### Stanley Park: Lian Yu and Beyond

While Lian Yu was supposedly a remote Chinese island, many of its jungle scenes were actually filmed in Stanley Park, Vancouver's 1,000-acre urban forest. The park's dense Pacific Northwest rainforest perfectly doubled for the mysterious island, with additional shooting in nearby Whytecliff Park and Lighthouse Park for coastal scenes.

**Filming Highlights:**
- Beaver Lake area for jungle training sequences
- Prospect Point for clifftop scenes
- Third Beach for island shore arrivals
- Lost Lagoon for swamp sequences

**Production Insights:**
The production team built semi-permanent structures deep in the park for recurring Lian Yu scenes. These included Oliver's makeshift camp, Slade's hideout, and various A.R.G.U.S. installations. Weather permitting, the crew could transform these Vancouver forests into a believable Pacific island setting within hours.

### Downtown Vancouver: Corporate Star City

The gleaming towers of downtown Vancouver provided the perfect backdrop for Star City's business district. Multiple buildings served as exteriors for key locations throughout the series.

**Major Building Locations:**
- **Marine Building (355 Burrard St):** Queen Consolidated exterior shots
- **Vancouver Public Library (350 W Georgia St):** Star City Library and government buildings
- **Harbour Centre (555 W Hastings St):** Various corporate villain headquarters
- **One Wall Centre (1088 Burrard St):** Palmer Technologies in later seasons

**Robson Square Complex:**
This modernist plaza served as Star City's civic center, hosting everything from mayoral speeches to terrorist attacks. The sunken plaza's distinctive architecture made it instantly recognizable in establishing shots.

### Coal Harbour: Waterfront Wealth

The upscale Coal Harbour neighborhood represented Star City's affluent waterfront district. Its luxury condos and marina settings were used for:

- Queen family penthouse exteriors
- Waterfront confrontations
- High-society event locations
- Yacht club scenes featuring the Queen's Gambit

### The Arrow Bunker: Burnaby Studios

While many locations were practical, the iconic Arrow Cave (later the Bunker) was a massive set built at Burnaby's Bridge Studios. This 15,000-square-foot set evolved throughout the series, from the initial foundry hideout to the high-tech bunker of later seasons.

**Set Evolution:**
- **Seasons 1-2:** Industrial foundry aesthetic with basic equipment
- **Season 3:** Expanded with medical bay and additional training areas
- **Seasons 4-8:** Full high-tech makeover with multiple levels and platforms
