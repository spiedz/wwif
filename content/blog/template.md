# Title of Your Blog Post

This is the introduction to your blog post. Make it engaging and interesting to draw the reader in. The first paragraph will have a drop cap applied to it for visual interest, and it will be displayed in a slightly larger font size. This is a great place to set up the topic of your blog post and entice readers to continue.

## Section Heading

This is a regular section of content. You can include paragraphs, links, and other elements here. Each section will be separated by a visual divider when rendered on the website. 

> This is a blockquote that will be styled differently to stand out from the rest of the content. Great for emphasizing important points or including quotes.

### Subsection Heading

This is a subsection with more specific content. You can nest sections as needed to organize your content logically.

- This is a bullet point in a list
- Another bullet point
- And another one

1. This is a numbered list item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item

## Location-Based Content

For blog posts about specific filming locations, you can use the following format to create location cards:

1. San Francisco Hills - Bullitt (1968)

### The Location

The steep streets of San Francisco's Russian Hill and Nob Hill neighborhoods served as the backdrop for one of cinema's most iconic car chases. The scene features Steve McQueen in a Highland Green 1968 Ford Mustang GT pursuing a black Dodge Charger across the city.

### Where to Visit

The chase covers many neighborhoods, but Taylor Street's steep sections offer the most recognizable views. Start at the intersection of Taylor and Filbert Streets and follow the route south to experience the famous jumps.

### Visitor Experience

You can drive the route yourself (carefully!), or join one of several movie-themed tours that visit these spots. Many driving tours will let you experience the thrill of the hills while explaining the filming techniques used.

2. Paris Streets - Ronin (1998)

### The Location

Director John Frankenheimer's high-octane chase through Paris features Robert De Niro and Jean Reno in a Peugeot 406 pursuing their targets through narrow streets, against traffic, and even through tunnels.

### Where to Visit

The chase mainly takes place around Les Halles, Pont du Carrousel, and along the Seine. The tunnel portion was filmed in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel, which has unfortunate historical significance beyond the film.

### Visitor Experience

The locations are all accessible on foot or via public transportation. Several film enthusiast guides offer walking tours of the exact shooting locations with behind-the-scenes trivia.

## Including Code Examples

If you're writing a technical post, you can include code examples using triple backticks:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello from Where Was It Filmed!");
}

## Conclusion

Sum up your blog post and perhaps include a call to action. Maybe encourage readers to visit these locations or share their own experiences in the comments.

Happy travels and film location hunting!
