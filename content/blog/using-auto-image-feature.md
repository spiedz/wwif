# Using the Auto-Image Feature for Film Locations

Creating content about film locations is now easier than ever with our new auto-image feature. This innovative tool automatically fetches relevant images for filming locations mentioned in your content, saving you time and effort in manually sourcing images.

## How the Auto-Image Feature Works

The auto-image feature uses SerpAPI to search for and retrieve high-quality images of filming locations. When you mention a location in your content, the system can automatically fetch an appropriate image.

### Basic Usage

To insert an auto-image in your markdown content, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![auto-image: Location Name](Optional description)
```

For example, let's see an image of the famous Hollywood Sign:

![auto-image: Hollywood Sign](Iconic landmark in Los Angeles)

## Customizing Your Images

You can customize the appearance of your auto-images by specifying dimensions and layout options.

### Custom Dimensions

Specify width and height for your images:

![auto-image: Empire State Building](Famous skyscraper in New York City, width=700, height=400)

### Layout Options

Choose from different layout styles:

#### Default Rounded Layout:

![auto-image: Big Ben](Famous clock tower in London, layout=rounded)

#### Square Layout:

![auto-image: Times Square](Busy intersection in New York City, layout=square)

#### Full Width Layout:

![auto-image: Golden Gate Bridge](Famous bridge in San Francisco, layout=full-width)

#### Card Layout with Shadow:

![auto-image: Griffith Observatory](Popular filming location in Los Angeles, layout=card)

## Auto-Detection from Coordinates

The system can automatically detect when you mention locations defined in your coordinates metadata. For example, when I talk about Los Angeles as a filming hub, the system recognizes this location.

Similarly, New York City appears in countless films, from classic noir to modern superhero blockbusters.

London has also been featured in numerous films, from James Bond to Harry Potter.

## Technical Details

The auto-image feature is powered by:

1. SerpAPI for image searches
2. Next.js Image component for optimization
3. Custom markdown processing
4. React components for rendering

This integration ensures high-quality images with proper loading, error handling, and fallbacks to placeholder images when needed.

## Content Creation Workflow

This feature is particularly useful for:

1. **Bulk Content Creation**: Generate multiple film location articles quickly
2. **Automation**: Perfect for integration with n8n or similar automation tools
3. **Content Updates**: Easily refresh existing content with new images

## Conclusion

The auto-image feature represents a significant improvement to our content creation workflow, allowing you to focus on writing compelling content while the system handles image sourcing automatically.

Try using auto-images in your next film location article and experience the difference!
