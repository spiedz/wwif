# Famous Movie Car Chase Locations You Can Actually Visit

Few sequences in cinema history are as thrilling as a well-executed car chase. The screeching tires, the breakneck speeds, and the stunning locations combine to create unforgettable moments on screen. But what if you could visit these places in person? In this guide, we'll explore famous filming locations where legendary car chases were shot and that you can actually visit today.

## What Makes a Great Car Chase Location?

The perfect car chase scene requires more than just fast cars and skilled drivers. The location itself plays a crucial role in creating a memorable sequence:

- **Distinctive Topography**: Hills, curves, and unique road layouts create visual interest
- **Recognizable Landmarks**: Iconic structures help orient viewers and establish the setting
- **Technical Challenges**: Obstacles that require impressive driving maneuvers
- **Visual Contrast**: Scenery that provides a striking backdrop for the action

The best filmmakers use these elements to create sequences that aren't just exciting but also visually stunning and geographically coherent.

## 1. Lombard Street, San Francisco

**Featured In**: "Bullitt" (1968), "The Streets of San Francisco" (various episodes)

**What Makes It Special**: Known as "the crookedest street in the world," Lombard Street's eight hairpin turns on a steep incline create a unique driving challenge that has been featured in numerous chase scenes.

**Visitor Experience**: You can drive down the street yourself (slowly, please!) or walk alongside it for spectacular views of San Francisco. The best photographs come from the bottom looking up or from nearby Coit Tower.

**Featured In**: "Ronin" (1998), "The Bourne Identity" (2002)

**What Makes It Special**: Paris offers narrow streets, roundabouts like the Arc de Triomphe (which has 12 converging avenues!), and recognizable landmarks that create perfect backdrops for high-speed pursuits.

**Visitor Experience**: Many tour companies offer movie-themed tours that will take you to famous filming spots. Alternatively, a self-guided walking tour can cover many locations, especially around Les Halles and Place de la Concorde.

**Featured In**: "The Italian Job" (2003 remake)

**What Makes It Special**: The confined space of the tunnel under the Los Angeles River created a claustrophobic and tense environment for the film's Mini Cooper chase scene.

**Visitor Experience**: The LA River tunnels are accessible and have become something of a pilgrimage site for film fans. Visit during the dry season, as the river level can rise quickly during rain.

**Location Coordinates**: {
  "lat": 34.0522,
