# 10 Iconic Movie Filming Locations in Chicago You Can Visit

Chicago has been the backdrop for countless classic films over the decades. Its distinctive architecture, beautiful lakefront, and urban landscape make it a perfect cinematic setting. Here's our guide to the most iconic movie filming locations in the Windy City that you can visit today.

## 1. Lower Wacker Drive - The Dark Knight

This underground street famously featured in the high-octane chase scene in Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* (2008), where the Batmobile pursues the Joker's convoy. The twisting concrete corridors create a perfect urban labyrinth for high-speed pursuits.

**Visitor tip:** Join a Batman filming locations tour to get the full experience, as Lower Wacker can be confusing to navigate on your own.

## 2. The Art Institute of Chicago - Ferris Bueller's Day Off

The scene where Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane contemplate the Georges Seurat painting is one of the most memorable moments in this 1986 John Hughes classic. The Art Institute remains one of the city's premier cultural attractions.

**Visitor tip:** The Art Institute is open daily and houses an extensive collection beyond what you see in the film.

## 3. Chicago Board of Trade - The Dark Knight, Batman Begins

This iconic building features prominently in both Nolan Batman films as part of the Gotham City skyline. Its distinctive Art Deco architecture makes it instantly recognizable.

**Visitor tip:** While the trading floor isn't open to the public, you can admire the building's exterior and lobby.

## 4. Marina City Towers - The Hunter

These distinctive "corn cob" towers were featured in Steve McQueen's 1980 film *The Hunter*, where a car famously drives off one of the parking levels into the Chicago River.

**Visitor tip:** While you can't recreate the stunt, you can dine at the restaurants at the base of the towers for great views.

## 5. Union Station - The Untouchables

The famous staircase scene from Brian De Palma's 1987 gangster film *The Untouchables* was filmed in the magnificent Great Hall of Union Station.

**Visitor tip:** The station is still active and open to the public, so you can recreate your own (less violent) version of the scene.

## 6. "L" Trains - Spider-Man 2, Source Code, While You Were Sleeping

Chicago's elevated trains have featured in numerous films, including action sequences and romantic moments.

**Visitor tip:** The Brown Line offers some of the most scenic views of the city while riding the "L."

## 7. Daley Plaza - The Blues Brothers

The plaza outside the Richard J. Daley Center was where the Blues Brothers advertised their show with a loudspeaker on top of their car.

**Visitor tip:** Visit during the summer for farmers markets and festivals often held in the plaza.

## 8. Chicago Theatre - Adventures in Babysitting

The iconic marquee of this historic theater has appeared in countless films, including the 1987 comedy *Adventures in Babysitting*.

**Visitor tip:** Take a guided tour of the theater to learn about its rich history and see the beautiful interior.

## 9. Wrigley Field - Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Break-Up

Chicago's beloved baseball stadium features in many films set in the city, most memorably in Ferris Bueller's perfect day off.

**Visitor tip:** Even if you're not a baseball fan, the historic stadium is worth a visit for its classic charm.

## 10. Navy Pier - The Dark Knight

Used as the location for Bruce Wayne's fundraiser for Harvey Dent, Navy Pier offers stunning views of the Chicago skyline.

**Visitor tip:** Visit at sunset for spectacular views of the city skyline and Lake Michigan.

## Planning Your Chicago Movie Locations Tour

Many of these locations are within walking distance of each other or easily accessible via public transportation. Consider allowing 2-3 days to visit all these locations and fully appreciate both the cinematic history and the attractions themselves.

Remember that Chicago weather can be unpredictable, so dress in layers and be prepared for sudden changes, especially if you're visiting in spring or fall.

Several tour companies offer specific movie location tours that cover many of these spots, which can be a great option if you want additional background information and behind-the-scenes stories.
