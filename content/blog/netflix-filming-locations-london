**Waypoint:** [Lancaster House, Stable Yard, St. James’s, SW1A 1BB](https://goo.gl/maps/wEQKZTxEAxxQtYy58)

Lancaster House serves as the on-screen Buckingham Palace in *The Crown*. The historic grandeur of this estate perfectly matches royal scenes from multiple seasons.

**Tip:** While not open to the general public, it’s located right next to St. James’s Park — great for photo ops and royal fans.

### 2. Enola Holmes — Old Royal Naval College

**Waypoint:** [King William Walk, Greenwich SE10 9NN](https://goo.gl/maps/XU5g6VuwhQzHHL6w6)

Used for several bustling street scenes, this architectural gem is a period film favorite — and not just in *Enola Holmes*. Fans will recognize it from *Les Misérables*, too.

### 3. Bridgerton — Ranger’s House

**Waypoint:** [Chesterfield Walk, London SE10 8QX](https://goo.gl/maps/hmDN29zGsFzW9wXv6)

The Bridgerton family’s home is none other than Greenwich’s Ranger’s House. The stately red-brick mansion is a hidden gem and open to the public.

### 4. Luther — Southbank Skatepark

**Waypoint:** [Belvedere Rd, London SE1 8XT](https://goo.gl/maps/2zUNddg2ogz9TRzV7)

DCI John Luther often walks this gritty part of central London. The skatepark and surrounding walkways appear across multiple episodes — very atmospheric at night.

### 5. Top Boy — Samuda Estate (aka Summerhouse)

**Waypoint:** [Stebondale St, London E14 3BJ](https://goo.gl/maps/z9YzpUn13bRmA2Lf9)

This East London housing estate is where the heart of *Top Boy* beats. While raw and real, it’s best to visit during the day and respectfully.
