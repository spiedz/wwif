# Hidden Filming Locations From Popular TV Shows You Didn't Know About

While iconic filming locations often steal the spotlight, many beloved TV shows hide their production magic in plain sight—using unexpected locations that fans might walk past without ever realizing their significance. These hidden gems offer the most dedicated viewers a chance to connect with their favorite series in ways casual tourists might miss.

In this guide, we'll uncover the lesser-known filming locations from some of the most popular TV shows, revealing the real-world places behind the fictional settings that have captured our imaginations.

## The Witcher: Poland's Hidden Fantasy Realms

Netflix's fantasy epic "The Witcher" (2019-present), starring Henry Cavill (and now Liam Hemsworth) as Geralt of Rivia, brings Andrzej Sapkowski's books to life with stunning visuals. While many know about the show's filming in Hungary and the Canary Islands, Poland harbors some of its most authentic yet overlooked locations.

### Ogrodzieniec Castle, Poland

This 14th-century castle ruin in southern Poland provided the backdrop for pivotal scenes in Season 1.

**Hidden gem factor:** 
- Used for the Battle of Sodden Hill sequence
- Many fans don't realize they can explore the actual ruins
- Located far from typical tourist routes

**How to visit:**
- Located about 1.5 hours from Krakow
- Open year-round with modest entry fees
- Best combined with a tour of the Eagle Nests Trail

**Behind the scenes:** The production team had to use drones to scout the location due to its remote positioning and complex layout. They chose the site specifically because it already somewhat resembled a battleground after centuries of wars and abandonment.

## Stranger Things: Georgia's 1980s Time Capsules

While "Stranger Things" (2016-present) is set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, most fans know it's primarily filmed in Georgia. However, many don't realize just how many everyday locations around Atlanta serve as the show's most memorable settings.

### Gwinnett Place Mall, Duluth, Georgia

This largely abandoned mall was transformed into the colorful Starcourt Mall for Season 3.

**Hidden gem factor:**
- The mall still stands but looks nothing like its vibrant on-screen counterpart
- The production built an entire working food court inside
- Most of the storefronts were custom-built sets

**How to visit:**
- The mall is largely closed to the public now
- Some exterior views are possible from parking areas
- Several nearby locations feature in the show and are more accessible

**Behind the scenes:** The production team spent over $67 million in Georgia during Season 3, creating over 1,500 jobs just for the Starcourt Mall sequences. They built over 40 storefronts inside the abandoned mall, many fully functional.

### Jackson, Georgia as Downtown Hawkins

The charming downtown area of Jackson, Georgia, stands in for Hawkins' main street in numerous scenes.

**Hidden gem factor:**
- Many buildings maintain the exact same exteriors seen on the show
- The library, police station, and general store are real buildings with different purposes
- Local businesses often display small "as seen in Stranger Things" signs

<img src="/images/hidden-filming-locations-tv-shows-stranger-things.jpg" alt="Downtown Jackson, Georgia used as Hawkins in Stranger Things">

For fans of hidden small-town filming locations, our article on [restaurants from movies you can visit](/blog/restaurants-from-movies-you-can-visit) features several diners that might look familiar from various productions.

## Ozark: Not Actually Filmed at the Ozarks

"Ozark" (2017-2022), starring Jason Bateman and Laura Linney, follows the Byrde family's dangerous entanglement with drug cartels and local criminals. Despite its name, very little of the show was actually filmed in Missouri's Ozark region.

### Lake Allatoona and Lake Lanier, Georgia

These Georgia lakes stand in for Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks throughout the series.

**Hidden gem factor:**
- The Blue Cat Lodge scenes were filmed at the real-life Little River Marina
- The Byrde family home is an actual lakeside property on Lake Allatoona
- Many waterfront scenes use clever angles to make Georgia look like Missouri

**How to visit:**
- Both lakes are within an hour's drive of Atlanta
- Many filming sites are on private property but visible from public areas
- Some locations like the former Blue Cat Lodge (now called JD's Bar-B-Que) welcome visitors

**Behind the scenes:** Production designers had to carefully study Missouri architecture and landscaping to transform Georgia locations. They even imported specific plants native to Missouri to enhance authenticity in some scenes.

### Silver Skillet Restaurant, Atlanta

This classic diner appears as the Missouri Belle Restaurant in later seasons.

**Hidden gem factor:**
- Operating since 1967, this diner maintains authentic vintage appeal
- The production used both interior and exterior shots
- You can sit in the exact booths where pivotal scenes were filmed

**How to visit:**

## Game of Thrones: The Lesser-Known Westeros

While most "Game of Thrones" (2011-2019) filming locations in Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Spain are well-documented, several fascinating spots remain relatively obscure to all but the most dedicated fans.

### Grjótagjá Cave, Iceland

This small lava cave with a thermal spring served as Jon and Ygritte's intimate love scene location in Season 3.

**Hidden gem factor:**
- The cave is natural but much smaller than it appears on screen
- Water temperature fluctuates dramatically, making swimming often impossible
- The interior shots were heavily modified with CGI

<img src="/images/hidden-filming-locations-tv-shows-got-cave.jpg" alt="Grjótagjá Cave in Iceland used in Game of Thrones">

**How to visit:**
- Located near Lake Mývatn in northern Iceland
- Accessible by rental car, about 6 hours from Reykjavik
- Be respectful as it's a delicate natural environment

**Behind the scenes:** The production could only film here briefly due to the cave's fragile ecosystem. Most of the scene was actually filmed on a constructed set that replicated the cave's appearance but allowed for better lighting and camera movement.

## Breaking Bad: Albuquerque's Secret Landmarks

"Breaking Bad" (2008-2013) put Albuquerque on the map for TV tourism, but beyond the obvious locations like Walter White's house and Los Pollos Hermanos, several significant filming spots remain overlooked.

### John B. Robert Dam

This unassuming flood control dam provided the backdrop for several pivotal desert scenes.

**Hidden gem factor:**

- Appears completely different depending on time of day
- Most tourists focus on urban locations instead

**How to visit:**
- Located in northeast Albuquerque
- Public access via hiking trails
- Best visited in morning or late afternoon for dramatic lighting

**Behind the scenes:** The production crew favored this location because it offered the appearance of remote desert while actually being close to city amenities. They could create the illusion of dangerous isolation while maintaining easy access for equipment and emergency services.

### The Grove Café & Market

This real café was where Walt and Lydia regularly met and where the famous Stevia poisoning scene occurred.

**Hidden gem factor:**
- Still operates as a popular local breakfast spot
- The exact table where Walt poisoned Lydia's tea is marked
- Much smaller in real life than it appears on screen

**How to visit:**

## Twin Peaks: Washington's Mysterious Corners

David Lynch's cult classic "Twin Peaks" (1990-1991, 2017) used numerous locations in Washington state that remain relatively untouched by mass tourism.

### Twede's Café (RR Diner), North Bend, Washington

The iconic diner where Agent Cooper enjoyed his "damn fine coffee and cherry pie."
