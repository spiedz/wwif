# TV Shows Filmed in Ireland: The Emerald Screen

Ireland's lush landscapes, ancient castles, and dramatic coastlines have made it one of the world's most sought-after filming destinations. From epic fantasy sagas to intimate contemporary dramas, the Emerald Isle provides a versatile and captivating backdrop that has enchanted audiences worldwide. Let's explore the most notable TV shows filmed in Ireland and discover how you can visit these magical locations yourself.

## Game of Thrones: From Winterfell to the Iron Islands

**Plot:** Based on George R.R. Martin's fantasy novels, this epic series follows noble families vying for the Iron Throne in the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos.  
**Cast:** Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey

While Northern Ireland served as the primary filming location for Game of Thrones, several iconic scenes were shot across the island:

### Castle Ward, County Down

This 18th-century mansion and its sprawling estate transformed into Winterfell, the ancestral home of House Stark. Visitors can tour the grounds where Bran Stark practiced archery and where many pivotal scenes from Season 1 were filmed.

### Ballintoy Harbour, County Antrim

This picturesque harbor on the Causeway Coastal Route became the Iron Islands, home to House Greyjoy. The scene where Theon Greyjoy returns to his homeland was filmed at this rugged coastal location.

### The Dark Hedges, County Antrim

This stunning avenue of beech trees served as the King's Road in Season 2. Though only appearing briefly in the show, it's become one of the most photographed natural phenomena in Northern Ireland.

## Vikings: Norse Warriors in the Irish Countryside

**Plot:** This historical drama follows the legendary Norse figure Ragnar Lothbrok and his descendants as they raid, trade, and explore during the Viking Age.  
**Cast:** Travis Fimmel, Katheryn Winnick, Alexander Ludwig, Gustaf Skarsg√•rd

### Wicklow Mountains, County Wicklow

The rugged terrain of the Wicklow Mountains frequently stood in for the Scandinavian landscape. Lough Tay, nicknamed "Guinness Lake" for its dark waters and white sand shore, served as the setting for Kattegat, the home village of the main characters.

### Powerscourt Waterfall, County Wicklow

This 121-meter cascade, Ireland's highest waterfall, featured in numerous scenes throughout the series, providing a dramatic natural backdrop for key moments.

## Normal People: Contemporary Ireland on Screen

### Dennis's Wee Shop, Derry

This corner shop (called McCool's in the show) is instantly recognizable to fans as a regular meeting spot for the characters.

### St. Columba's College, Derry

This school served as the exterior for the fictional "Our Lady Immaculate College" where much of the series takes place.

**Behind the Scenes:** While most of the series was filmed in Derry, some Belfast locations were used as well. The famous "Derry Girls mural" painted on the side of Badger's Bar has become a popular tourist attraction.

## Penny Dreadful: Gothic Horror in the Irish Countryside

**Plot:** This horror series brings together iconic literary characters like Dorian Gray, Victor Frankenstein, and characters from Dracula in a Victorian London setting.

### Dublin Castle, Dublin

This historic complex stood in for various London locations, with its period architecture providing an authentic 19th-century atmosphere.

### Kilruddery House, County Wicklow

This stunning 17th-century estate served as various grand estates throughout the series, with its manicured gardens and imposing architecture.
