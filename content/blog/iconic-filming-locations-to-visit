## 1. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (Alnwick Castle, UK)

**Film**: Harry Potter series (2001-2011)  
**Location**: Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, England

The Harry Potter franchise transformed this 11th-century castle into the magical Hogwarts School where young wizards learn their craft. While multiple locations were used to create Hogwarts, Alnwick Castle is where many of the exterior scenes were filmed, including the memorable broomstick flying lessons in "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone."

**Behind the Scenes**: The castle's inner bailey was transformed into the main courtyard of Hogwarts, where students practiced flying on broomsticks under Madam Hooch's instruction. The filmmakers had to carefully remove or disguise modern elements like security cameras and fire extinguishers during filming.

**How to Visit**: Alnwick Castle is open to visitors from late March to October. The castle offers specific "Broomstick Training" sessions where Potter fans can learn to fly in the exact spot where Harry had his first flying lesson. The castle is located about an hour's drive north of Newcastle and is easily accessible by car or public transportation.

## 2. Walter White's House (Albuquerque, USA)

**Show**: Breaking Bad (2008-2013)  
**Location**: Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

The unassuming suburban home that served as the White family residence in "Breaking Bad" has become one of television's most recognizable houses. Located in a quiet neighborhood in Albuquerque, this private residence was used for exterior shots throughout the series.

**Behind the Scenes**: The actual homeowners have lived in the house for over 40 years and have dealt with thousands of fans visiting since the show's popularity exploded. The pizza thrown onto the roof by Walter White was done in a single take by actor Bryan Cranston, unplanned and unrehearsed!

**How to Visit**: While you can drive by the house (3828 Piermont Drive NE, Albuquerque), it's important to remember this is a private residence. The owners have had to erect fencing and "No Trespassing" signs due to over-enthusiastic fans. Instead, take an organized Breaking Bad tour, which respectfully passes the house and visits other filming locations like the A1A Car Wash and Los Pollos Hermanos (actually a restaurant called Twisters).

## 3. The Overlook Hotel (Timberline Lodge, USA)

**Film**: The Shining (1980)  
**Location**: Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood, Oregon, USA

Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel "The Shining" used the exterior of Timberline Lodge as the fictional Overlook Hotel, creating one of cinema's most iconic horror settings. While the interior scenes were filmed on sets, the imposing exterior of this historic mountain lodge is instantly recognizable to fans.

**Behind the Scenes**: The hotel actually requested that Kubrick change the haunted room number from 217 (as in King's novel) to the non-existent room 237, as they feared guests would refuse to stay in the actual room. Interestingly, today room 217 is the most requested room at the lodge!

**How to Visit**: Timberline Lodge is a fully operational hotel and ski resort open year-round. You can book accommodations, enjoy a meal at the restaurant, or simply visit for the day to explore the grounds. The hotel embraces its cinematic history and staff are accustomed to fans recreating the famous "Here's Johnny!" pose by the entrance.

## 4. Highclere Castle (Downton Abbey, UK)

**Show**: Downton Abbey (2010-2015)  
**Location**: Highclere Castle, Hampshire, England

The magnificent Highclere Castle served as the main filming location for the beloved period drama "Downton Abbey." This Victorian-era country house became the fictional Yorkshire estate of the Crawley family, with both exterior and many interior scenes filmed on location.

**Behind the Scenes**: Highclere Castle has been the country seat of the Earls of Carnarvon since 1679. The current Countess of Carnarvon actually lives in the castle and has written books about its history. Unlike many film locations, much of the interior filming for Downton Abbey used the castle's actual rooms rather than studio sets.

**How to Visit**: Highclere Castle opens to the public on select dates throughout the year, typically during summer and around holidays. Tickets should be booked well in advance as they sell out quickly. Visitors can explore the main state rooms featured in the series, including the library, drawing room, and iconic entrance hall with its grand staircase.

## 5. King's Landing (Dubrovnik, Croatia)

**Show**: Game of Thrones (2011-2019)  
**Location**: Dubrovnik, Croatia

The stunning medieval walled city of Dubrovnik served as the primary filming location for King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms in HBO's "Game of Thrones." The city's distinctive orange rooftops, ancient walls, and narrow streets provided the perfect setting for the show's political intrigue.

**Behind the Scenes**: When filming in Dubrovnik's UNESCO World Heritage site, the production team had to follow strict rules, including using rubber swords during filming on the city walls for safety. The famous "Walk of Shame" scene was particularly challenging, requiring streets to be closed and hundreds of extras.

**How to Visit**: Dubrovnik is accessible year-round, though the summer months can be extremely crowded. Numerous "Game of Thrones" themed tours take visitors to key filming locations, including the Jesuit Staircase (site of Cersei's walk of atonement), Fort Lovrijenac (the Red Keep), and the city walls which feature in many panoramic shots of King's Landing.

## 6. Jurassic Park (Kualoa Ranch, Hawaii)

**Film**: Jurassic Park franchise (1993-present)  
**Location**: Kualoa Ranch, Oahu, Hawaii

The breathtaking landscapes of Kualoa Ranch on Oahu's eastern coast have served as the prehistoric playground for dinosaurs throughout the Jurassic Park and Jurassic World films. This 4,000-acre private nature reserve features the iconic valleys and mountains seen in the original film's most memorable scenes.

**Behind the Scenes**: The fallen tree that Dr. Grant and the children hide behind during the gallimimus stampede scene in the original film remained at Kualoa Ranch for years as a popular photo opportunity for visitors until it eventually decomposed naturally.

**How to Visit**: Kualoa Ranch offers several different tour options specifically focused on movie sites, including Hollywood tours that showcase Jurassic Park locations, along with sites from other films shot there like "50 First Dates" and "Kong: Skull Island." The most popular spot is the Kaaawa Valley, recognizable as the site where the original Jurassic Park characters encounter a herd of gallimimus and later find dinosaur eggs.

## 7. A1A Car Wash (Albuquerque, USA)

**Show**: Breaking Bad (2008-2013)  
**Location**: Octopus Car Wash (now Mister Car Wash), Albuquerque, New Mexico

The A1A Car Wash, where Walter White laundered his drug money, was filmed at the actual Octopus Car Wash in Albuquerque (now renamed Mister Car Wash). This functional business became a central location in the later seasons of "Breaking Bad."

**Behind the Scenes**: The production designers added the A1A sign just for filming days, but would remove it when not shooting. Local customers would sometimes arrive to wash their cars during filming breaks, not realizing they were on a television set!

**How to Visit**: The car wash is still operational (now under the Mister Car Wash brand) and located at 9516 Snow Heights Circle NE in Albuquerque. Fans can visit during business hours and even get their car washed where Skyler and Walter ran their money laundering operation.

## 8. Hobbiton (Matamata, New Zealand)

**Films**: The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies (2001-2014)  
**Location**: Matamata, North Island, New Zealand

Perhaps the most fully realized film set ever created, Hobbiton was built on a sheep farm near Matamata for "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Unlike most movie sets, it was rebuilt permanently for "The Hobbit" films and has been preserved as a visitor attraction, complete with 44 hobbit holes and the Green Dragon Inn.

**Behind the Scenes**: Director Peter Jackson first spotted the Alexander farm while conducting an aerial search for filming locations. The New Zealand army was brought in to build a road to the site and construct the original set. For "The Hobbit" films, the set was rebuilt using more permanent materials, with incredible attention to detail including real vegetable gardens and fruit on the trees.

**How to Visit**: Daily tours operate year-round to the Hobbiton Movie Set. The standard tour includes a guided walk through The Shire, a stop at Bag End, and concludes with a complimentary drink at the Green Dragon Inn. Evening banquet tours and special events are also available. The site is located about 2 hours' drive from Auckland.

## 9. Skellig Michael (Ireland)

**Films**: Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)  
**Location**: Skellig Michael, County Kerry, Ireland

This remote, rocky island off the coast of Ireland served as Luke Skywalker's hideaway in the recent Star Wars sequel trilogy. The ancient monastery perched atop this UNESCO World Heritage site provided an otherworldly setting for Rey's first encounter with the legendary Jedi.

**Behind the Scenes**: The production team had to carry all equipment up the 600+ ancient stone steps to the monastery. Due to the island's protected status, filming time was extremely limited, and the crew had to work around restrictions designed to protect the local wildlife, including puffin colonies.

**How to Visit**: Skellig Michael is accessible only by boat and only during the summer months (typically May through September). Visitor numbers are strictly controlled, with only a handful of licensed boat operators permitted to land on the island. Advance booking is essential, often months ahead. The journey involves a sometimes rough boat ride followed by a steep climb up hundreds of ancient stone steps.

## 10. Twin Peaks Double R Diner (North Bend, USA)

**Show**: Twin Peaks (1990-1991, 2017)  
**Location**: Twede's Cafe, North Bend, Washington, USA

The Double R Diner, where characters in David Lynch's cult classic "Twin Peaks" frequently gathered for "damn fine coffee" and cherry pie, is actually Twede's Cafe in North Bend, Washington. This real working restaurant was transformed into the fictional diner for both the original series and the 2017 revival.

**Behind the Scenes**: The cafe was originally called the Mar-T Cafe during filming of the original series but was later renamed Twede's. After a fire in 2000, the interior looked quite different until the 2017 revival, when production designers restored it to look exactly like the original Double R Diner set.

**How to Visit**: Twede's Cafe is open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Fans can sit in the same booths used in filming and order the "Twin Peaks Cherry Pie" and a cup of coffee, just like FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper. The cafe embraces its television fame with Twin Peaks memorabilia on display. North Bend is approximately 30 miles east of Seattle and is part of the larger "Twin Peaks Country" that fans can explore.

## Planning Your Film Location Adventure

When planning a trip to these iconic filming locations, keep these tips in mind:

3. **Book in advance**: Popular locations like Skellig Michael and Hobbiton require advance reservations, sometimes months ahead.
