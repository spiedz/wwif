    - "Filming spanned both hemispheres, with primary work done across New Zealand’s North Island."
    - "Helensville and Huntly provided rural and industrial backdrops to mimic Minecraft’s varied zones."
    - "Vancouver and Montréal helped fill in for stylized city and endgame sequences."
    - "Wētā FX contributed to visual effects, voxelizing real-world terrain for key transitions."
    - "Set designers recreated props like crafting tables and trees to scale using foam, paint, and 3D-printing."
