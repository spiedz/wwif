## 🗺️ Plan Your Visit

Ready to step into the ghostly footsteps of *Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*? Here's how to make your cinematic journey a reality!

### 🏨 Where to Stay

- **💰 Budget:** **Comfort Inn & Suites St. Johnsbury** - ~$100-150/night - Located a short drive from East Corinth, offering comfortable stays with essential amenities for those on a tighter budget.

- **🏛️ Mid-Range:** **The Norwich Inn** (near East Corinth) - ~$180-250/night - A historic, charming inn offering a more traditional New England experience, perfect for immersing yourself in the regional atmosphere.

### 🚗 Getting Around

- **🚇 Metro:** For the UK locations (Leavesden, Hitchin), the London Underground and National Rail services are excellent. Leavesden is easily accessible from Watford Junction station, and Hitchin has its own train station.

### 📸 Photo Tips

- **🌅 Best Times:** Early morning or late afternoon light often provides the best 'golden hour' for photography, enhancing architectural details and creating a cinematic mood. Vermont scenery is beautiful in fall.

- **📱 Instagram Spots:** In East Corinth, try to capture the iconic church and post office. For UK street scenes, look for classic telephone booths or unique shopfronts that evoke a timeless English feel.
