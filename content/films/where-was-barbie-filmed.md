behindTheScenes:
  intro: "Greta Gerwig's vision for Barbie was to blend hyper-stylized artificiality with relatable human experiences. This meant constructing most of Barbieland at Leavesden Studios with practical sets, minimizing CGI where possible to give it a tangible, childlike quality. When Barbie and Ken enter the 'Real World,' the filming shifts to authentic Los Angeles locations, creating a stark, hilarious contrast to their perfect pink parallel universe. The attention to detail in transforming these spaces, or letting their natural chaos shine, was key to the film's playful narrative."
  facts:
    - "The production bought so much pink paint for Barbieland, it reportedly caused a global shortage!"
    - "Margot Robbie, who plays Barbie, was also a producer on the film, passionately driving it forward for years."
    - "Greta Gerwig chose practical effects and sets over CGI to evoke a theatrical, handmade feel for Barbieland."
    - "Ryan Gosling's bleached blonde hair and tanned look required significant commitment and maintenance."
    - "Scenes featuring Barbie and Ken rollerblading on Venice Beach attracted huge crowds of onlookers, making filming a challenge."
    - "The dream house sequences were meticulously crafted on soundstages at Leavesden, inspired by mid-century modern architecture."
    - "Director Greta Gerwig insisted on a diverse cast of Barbies and Kens to reflect the doll's broad appeal."
    - "The film's satirical take on gender roles was explored not just through dialogue but also through the visual contrast of Barbieland and the real world."
    - "The 'Perfect Day' sequence in Barbieland was shot with precise choreography, almost like a musical number."
    - "Many of the film's costumes were custom-made, with designers drawing inspiration from various eras of Barbie fashion."
    - "The final scene with Barbie's momentous decision was filmed in a surprisingly ordinary location, emphasizing her journey to humanity."
    - "Part of the real-world scenes necessitated capturing genuine reaction from passersby, adding to the comedic chaos."
