## ❓ Quick Answers

**🎬 Is this based on a true story?**

"Coco" is not based on a single true story but is a deeply researched and culturally authentic homage to Mexico's Día de Muertos traditions and family values. Its narrative is fictional, drawing inspiration from countless real-life elements.


**🗺️ Can I visit all locations in one day?**

No, absolutely not! Mexico City's locations (Bellas Artes, Coyoacán, Frida Kahlo House) can be grouped over two days. San Andrés Mixquic requires a dedicated half-day or evening trip, especially during Día de Muertos. Guanajuato City is located several hours away and requires a separate 2-3 day trip to fully explore.


**💰 How much should I budget?**

For Mexico City, budget around $50-100 USD per person per day for mid-range accommodation, food, and attractions. For Guanajuato, it might be slightly less, around $40-80 USD per person per day. This excludes international flights.


**📱 Are there guided tours?**

Yes! Many tours are available in Mexico City that cover the historic center and Coyoacán. You can also find specialized Día de Muertos tours to Mixquic, and walking tours are popular in Guanajuato. Look for reputable local tour operators online.


**🎭 When was this filmed?**

"Coco" was an animated film, so it wasn't "filmed" in the traditional sense. However, Pixar's research and inspiration trips to Mexico spanned over six years during the production, from roughly 2011 to 2017.


**🌍 Is Mexico safe for tourists?**

Like any large country, Mexico has areas with varying safety levels. Tourist destinations like Mexico City and Guanajuato are generally safe for visitors, especially in popular, well-trafficked areas. Exercise common sense, be aware of your surroundings, and avoid walking alone at night in unfamiliar areas. Research current travel advisories before your trip.
