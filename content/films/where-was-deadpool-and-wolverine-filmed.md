  intro: >-
    *Deadpool & Wolverine* marks a milestone for the Merc with a Mouth’s MCU debut. Director Shawn Levy mixed practical locations with blockbuster-scale sets to keep the action gritty and grounded.
  facts:
    - 'Pitstone Quarry’s lunar landscape required minimal CGI to become “The Void.”'
    - 'Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman performed many stunts themselves, including sword work on Holkham Beach.'
    - 'Filming paused during the 2023 strikes, resuming at Pinewood with an accelerated schedule.'
    - 'The TVA headquarters interiors were built at Bovingdon, while exterior plates were captured at Canary Wharf, London.'
    - 'Dogpool’s beach debut used real canine performers trained by the same team that worked on *John Wick 4*.'

# Where Was *Deadpool & Wolverine* Filmed?

Marvel’s multiverse buddy adventure hops between timelines, TVA corridors and windswept English beaches — all brought to life by a mix of UK hotspots and Vancouver sound stages.

## Introduction to *Deadpool & Wolverine*

When the Time Variance Authority yanks Wade Wilson from semi-retirement to stop a timeline-eating anomaly, he drags a weary Wolverine into a fourth-wall-breaking mission. Expect quips, claws and cameos galore.

## Major Filming Locations

### Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire

*Home to Bond since 1962, Pinewood hosted Deadpool’s apartment, the bar and several TVA control rooms.*

### Pitstone Quarry — “The Void”

Bleak chalk cliffs form the backdrop for the film’s portal battles.

### Holkham Beach, Norfolk

Fans will recognise the sweeping dunes where Dogpool buries… well, a lot.

### Vancouver Film Studios

Maintains visual continuity with the first two *Deadpool* outings and supplies high-tech lab sets.

### Bovingdon Airfield Studios

Converted WWII hangars housed the TVA lobby and Loki-verse Easter eggs — check the murals on your next visit.

**Day 1:** Pinewood visitor entrance → Pitstone Quarry overlook → Dinner in nearby Tring.  
**Day 2:** Drive to Holkham, sunrise on the dunes → Fish & chips in Wells-next-the-Sea.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 🗺️ Was *Deadpool & Wolverine* filmed in the same quarry as *The Batman*?

### 🌌 Is the TVA headquarters a real building?

### 🐶 Where was Dogpool’s beach scene shot?

That adorable intro was filmed on **Holkham Beach** in Norfolk. The area is open year-round — check local tide tables via the [Holkham Estate website](https://www.holkham.co.uk).

### ✈️ Can I tour Pinewood Studios?

Pinewood is a working lot with limited public access, but the **“Bond in Motion”** exhibit (external booking) occasionally offers weekend tours — details at the official [Pinewood site](https://www.pinewoodstudios.com).

### 🎟️ Will there be set tours for *Deadpool & Wolverine*?

Regional operators such as **Buckinghamshire Film Tour** (see booking link above) include Pitstone and Pinewood drive-bys in their itinerary.
