behindTheScenes:
  intro: "Mark Waters, the director, skillfully brought Tina Fey's razor-sharp script to life, transforming Toronto's urban landscape into the suburban jungles of Illinois. The production team masterfully selected locations that captured the quintessential American high school feel, creating a world both familiar and distinctly 'Mean Girls.' This careful choice of backdrops was crucial in grounding the film's satirical humor in a believable reality, making North Shore High feel like a place we all *almost* went to."
  facts:
    - "Tina Fey, the screenwriter, drew inspiration from Rosalind Wiseman's non-fiction self-help book 'Queen Bees and Wannabes'."
    - "Lindsay Lohan originally auditioned for the role of Regina George, but director Mark Waters convinced her Cady was a better fit."
    - "Rachel McAdams, who played Regina, was actually 8 years older than Lindsay Lohan, playing a high schooler."
    - "Amanda Seyfried's iconic role as Karen Smith was her first-ever film role. She initially auditioned for Cady Heron."
    - "The phrase 'fetch' was entirely fabricated for the movie and wasn't a real slang term before its release."
    - "Despite being set in Illinois, almost the entire movie was filmed in and around Toronto, saving production costs."
    - "The iconic 'Jingle Bell Rock' dance sequence was largely improvised and choreographed by the cast on the day of filming."
    - "The notorious Kälteen Bars, designed to make Cady gain weight, were reportedly made from German chocolate."
    - "The infamous Burn Book was a meticulously crafted prop, filled with specific details and photos by the art department."
    - "Director Mark Waters had previously worked with Lindsay Lohan on "Freaky Friday," which helped build their strong collaborative dynamic."
    - "The film's cultural impact became so massive that it spawned a Broadway musical and a new musical film adaptation in 2024."
    - "Paramount Pictures initially wanted to release the film straight to video, but the cast and crew pushed for a theatrical release."
