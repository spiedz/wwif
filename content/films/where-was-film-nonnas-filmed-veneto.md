Prepare to be whisked away to a sun-drenched, bell-bottomed era with *Film Nonnas* (original title: *Le mie ragazze di carta*), a captivating Italian comedy-drama now streaming on Netflix. This delightful film doesn't just tell a story; it immerses you in the authentic atmosphere of Italy's Veneto region circa 1978. Following young Tiberio and his family as they move from the countryside to the city, we are treated to a cinematic love letter to a time of change, innocence, and the alluring flicker of the silver screen. The enchanting Veneto region, with its timeless beauty and rich cultural tapestry, has long captivated filmmakers. It has provided the perfect canvas not only for intimate, nostalgic journeys like *Film Nonnas* but also for grander cinematic tales, including scenes from Michael Radford's [*The Merchant of Venice* (2004)](https://wherewasitfilmed.co/films/where-was-the-merchant-of-venice-filmed), which brought Shakespeare's drama to life in nearby Venice.

The heart of *Film Nonnas* beats strongest in **Treviso**, a city often poetically described as "Little Venice" due to its intricate network of canals, historic watermills, and frescoed building facades. As you watch Tiberio navigate his new urban life, you'll fall in love with Treviso's historic center. Its charming cobblestone streets, terracotta-roofed houses, and arcaded walkways become the playground for his adventures and discoveries. Key social interactions and Tiberio's initial encounters with the controversial adult cinema managed by the eccentric Lombardoni unfold in the bustling **Piazza dei Signori**. This main square, dominated by the impressive Palazzo dei Trecento, is the vibrant core of Treviso, pulsating with local life. For moments of reflection and boyish escapades, the film beautifully utilizes the serene banks of the **Sile River**, particularly the popular pedestrian and cycling path known as "Restera." This lush, green artery winding through and around Treviso offers a peaceful contrast to the lively town center. The filmmakers also ventured into **Casier**, a quaint neighboring town along the Sile, further enhancing the film's authentic 1970s Veneto ambiance with its traditional Italian village charm.

For cinephiles and Italophiles alike, exploring the *Film Nonnas* filming locations offers a uniquely immersive experience. Imagine yourself cycling along the Sile, just as Tiberio did, feeling the gentle Veneto breeze. Picture perusing the shops under the ancient porticoes of Treviso or enjoying a *cicchetto* (a local tapas-style snack) in a traditional *osteria* featured subtly in the film. This isn't just about seeing movie sets; it's about stepping into a living, breathing postcard from 1970s Italy. The Province of Treviso, and indeed the entire Veneto region, is a treasure trove of history, art, exquisite cuisine (hello, Prosecco region!), and now, cherished cinematic memories.

Discovering the *Film Nonnas* filming locations means embarking on a journey beyond the screen. It's an invitation to explore a captivating corner of Italy, rich in cultural heritage and cinematic allure. From the specific, heartwarming settings of Tiberio's youth in Treviso to the broader dramatic landscapes of Veneto that have graced films like [*The Merchant of Venice* (2004)](https://wherewasitfilmed.co/films/where-was-the-merchant-of-venice-filmed), this region promises an unforgettable adventure for film enthusiasts and discerning travelers. The charm of Italian cinema, beautifully encapsulated in *Film Nonnas*, is waiting for you to explore.
