- 🎨 **Color Coordination:** Each alien species and environment had a meticulously planned color palette, influencing lighting and set design to ensure visual consistency and storytelling.

- 🎯 **Seamless CGI:** While practical sets formed the foundation, cutting-edge CGI seamlessly integrated alien flora, fauna, and spaceships, often building upon real-world textures and landscapes.
