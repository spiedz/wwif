This public forest is a haven for hikers, bikers, and equestrians, offering miles of trails through diverse ecosystems. Its raw, untouched beauty made it a perfect stand-in for the Arena's untamed wilderness.

**🎥 In the Film**

Many of the intense survival scenes set within the Hunger Games Arena were filmed in DuPont State Forest. The iconic Triple Falls, visible in the image, was a prominent feature during Katniss's desperate flight and survival. The forest's dense woods and rugged terrain provided the ideal backdrop for the tributes' struggle against each other and the Gamemakers.

### 🎬 Henry River Mill Village, Hildebran, North Carolina, USA - Welcome to District 12 🏚️

<img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/46943665-hunger-games-still-henry-river-mills-village-500.jpg?v=1349480273&w=1600&h=900" alt="An old, weathered building in Henry River Mill Village, resembling the bleak homes of District 12 from The Hunger Games" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

**🏛️ The Location**

Henry River Mill Village is a unique, nearly abandoned 19th-century textile mill village, complete with original mill buildings and workers' homes. The eerie, time-capsule quality of the village, with its untouched dilapidation, made it a prime location. It’s a privately owned site, preserved as a ghost town.

**🎥 In the Film**

This village served as the primary set for District 12, Katniss Everdeen's impoverished home. The rundown houses and general bleakness perfectly captured the oppressive atmosphere of the coal-mining district. The Mellark Bakery and Katniss's humble home were actual buildings within this village, minimally altered for filming.

**📍 Visitor Info**

- **📍 Address:** Henry River Rd, Hildebran, NC 28637 (Private Property)
- **🕒 Hours:** Typically closed to the public, check their official site for limited tour availability or special events.
- **💰 Admission:** Varies by tour, typically $20-$40 per person.
- **🌐 Website:** https://www.henryrivermillvillage.com/

**💡 Pro Tip:** Given its private status, you must book a tour in advance. Do not attempt to visit without explicit permission, as it is considered trespassing.

**🎬 Fun Fact:** Many of the set decorations for District 12 were sourced from local antique shops and flea markets, adding to the authentic, worn-out feel.

### 🎬 Ramblewood Golf Club (now The Tradition Golf Club at Crystal Lake), Charlotte, North Carolina, USA - Early Arena Training ⛳

<img src="https://lookaside.fbsbx.com/lookaside/crawler/media/?media_id=1057031252627277" alt="Lush, green landscape of Ramblewood Golf Club (now The Tradition Golf Club), featuring a large pond and trees, hinting at the Arena's training grounds" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

**🏛️ The Location**

Once known as Ramblewood Golf Club, this location is now The Tradition Golf Club at Crystal Lake, a well-maintained private golf course in Charlotte. Its expansive, manicured grounds and natural ponds provide a stark contrast to the gritty District 12, offering diverse landscapes within its private property.

**🎥 In the Film**

Parts of the tribute training scenes and some of the early Arena sequences were filmed here. Although a golf course, its rolling hills, wide-open spaces, and secluded pockets provided the necessary scale and variety for the Gamemakers' initial tests and the tributes' first moments in the Arena.

**📍 Visitor Info**

- **📍 Address:** 8027 Blair Rd, Charlotte, NC 28216
- **🕒 Hours:** Private golf club; specific hours for members and guests.
- **💰 Admission:** Green fees apply for golfers. Not generally open for public film tourism.
- **🌐 Website:** https://www.traditiongolf.com/

**💡 Pro Tip:** Unless you're a golfer or playing a round, this location isn't set up for film tourism. You might catch a glimpse of the grounds from public roads nearby.

**🎬 Fun Fact:** The area around the 'lake' on the golf course was transformed to appear as a less-than-tranquil water hazard where tributes had to navigate obstacles.

### 🎬 Big Ivy – Pisgah National Forest, Barnardsville, North Carolina, USA - Deep Wilderness Survival 🌲

<img src="https://movie-locations.com/movies/h/Hunger-Games-Triple-Falls.jpg" alt="Dense forest of Pisgah National Forest, similar to DuPont State Forest, featuring rocky outcrops and mature trees, used for deep wilderness Arena scenes" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

**🏛️ The Location**

Big Ivy, a lesser-known but equally stunning section of Pisgah National Forest near Barnardsville, is characterized by its old-growth forests, dense undergrowth, and rugged mountainous terrain. It offers a truly wild and remote feel, perfect for embodying the Arena's darkest corners. It's popular for serious hikers and off-road adventurers.

**🎥 In the Film**

Complementing DuPont State Forest, the Big Ivy area was utilized for some of the deeper, more remote scenes within the Hunger Games Arena. The thick canopy and challenging landscape provided the perfect backdrop for Katniss's solitary moments, her encounters with tracker jackers, and her efforts to evade other tributes.

**📍 Visitor Info**

- **📍 Address:** Access points near Barnardsville, NC. Example: Big Ivy Rd, Barnardsville, NC 28709
- **🕒 Hours:** Open 24/7, year-round (check for seasonal road closures, especially in winter).
- **💰 Admission:** Free
- **🌐 Website:** https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nfsnc/recarea/?recid=48421

**💡 Pro Tip:** This area is wilder than DuPont, so come prepared with proper hiking gear, navigation tools, and perhaps a hiking buddy. Cell service can be spotty.

**🎬 Fun Fact:** The film crew had to take extra precautions to avoid disturbing the natural wildlife and fragile ecosystems while filming in such pristine wilderness areas.

### 🎬 North Fork Reservoir (Asheville Watershed), Black Mountain, North Carolina, USA - The Arena's Water Hazard 💧

<img src="https://www.blackmountainnews.com/gcdn/presto/2020/02/21/PBMN/4438fc04-0e05-4835-b22e-4a8bc2b7251b-D14036_Watershed_055.jpg" alt="Serene view of North Fork Reservoir, part of Asheville's watershed, with calm water and tree-lined shores, used for water-based Arena scenes" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

**🏛️ The Location**

The North Fork Reservoir is a vital part of Asheville's municipal water supply, nestled in the mountains near Black Mountain. Due to its function as a watershed, access to the reservoir itself is highly restricted to protect water quality. The surrounding forested areas, however, offer a glimpse of the tranquil yet imposing natural environment.

**🎥 In the Film**

Although public access to the reservoir is limited, specific scenes requiring a large body of water within the Arena were filmed here. These moments helped to establish the diverse and dangerous topography of the Hunger Games Arena, ensuring that the tributes faced challenges from various natural elements.

**📍 Visitor Info**

- **📍 Address:** Restricted access points around Black Mountain, NC. Not generally open for public visitation.
- **🕒 Hours:** N/A (Restricted access)
- **💰 Admission:** Free (for surrounding roads/trails that are publicly accessible)
- **🌐 Website:** https://www.ashevillenc.gov/departments/water/water-shed-watershed-resources/
