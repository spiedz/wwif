behindTheScenes:
  intro: "Jared Hess, the director and co-writer, crafted 'Napoleon Dynamite' as a quirky, independent film born from his own experiences growing up in rural Idaho. He deliberately chose to film entirely in Preston, a small town that perfectly encapsulated the film's unique, slightly off-kilter aesthetic. The production embraced the authentic, untouched charm of Preston, using real homes, schools, and businesses to create a believable, if eccentric, world that felt both familiar and strangely alien."
  facts:
    - "The film was shot in just 23 days, an incredibly tight schedule for such a rich story."
    - "It cost only $400,000 to make but grossed over $46 million worldwide, a true indie success story."
    - "Many props, like the infamous 'Liger' drawing, were found on location or created by the crew."
    - "Jon Heder was paid only $1,000 for his iconic role, a stark contrast to the film's massive success."
    - "The happy ending, featuring the final wedding sequence, was added after test audiences didn't respond well to an originally ambiguous ending."
    - "The famous dance scene was improvised by Jon Heder on the spot, relying solely on his past dance experience."
    - "The initial title was 'Peluca,' which is Spanish for wig, reflecting Napoleon's distinctive hair."
    - "The movie's cult success led to a brief animated series, continuing the adventures of the Dynamite family."
    - "Jared Hess based Napoleon's character on himself and his brothers' awkward teenage years and experiences."
    - "The 'Vote for Pedro' shirts became an instant pop culture phenomenon, seen everywhere for years."
    - "To save money, the cast and crew largely stayed with community members in Preston, building local ties."
    - "While ligers are real, they are indeed hybrid big cats, not magical creatures bred for skills in magic."
