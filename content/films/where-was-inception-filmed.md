      The famous Paris folding scene combined practical effects with CGI - real
      buildings were not actually folded!

      The zero-gravity hotel corridor fight scene took three weeks to film and
      used a massive rotating set rather than digital effects.

      The snow fortress scenes were filmed in the mountains of Alberta, Canada,
      not in the Alps as many viewers assume.

## Inception: The World Inside Dreams

Christopher Nolan's mind-bending 2010 thriller "Inception" took audiences on a journey not just through different layers of dreams, but also across stunning locations around the world. The film, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as dream extractor Dom Cobb, uses its international settings to enhance the disorienting nature of its narrative.

What makes "Inception" particularly interesting from a filming location perspective is how Nolan used real-world architecture to create the surreal dreamscapes that define the film. From the folding streets of Paris to the gravity-defying hallways of a fictional hotel, many of the film's most memorable moments were anchored in actual locations that you can visit.

The film's production spanned three continents, with filming taking place in six different countries. Each location was carefully chosen to represent different dream levels and realities within the complex narrative. The urban landscapes of Paris, the narrow streets of Tangier, and the snow-covered mountains of Canada all played crucial roles in bringing the film's intricate dreamworlds to life.

Whether you're a film enthusiast, architecture lover, or world traveler, exploring the real-world locations of "Inception" offers a fascinating way to experience the intersection of cinema and reality. Just as the characters in the film navigate between dreams and reality, visitors to these locations can experience the thrill of standing where this groundbreaking film was made.
