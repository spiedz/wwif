It's truly a moment that cements Petra's status in cinematic history.

The Church of San Barnaba (Chiesa di San Barnaba) is a Roman Catholic church located in the Dorsoduro sestiere of Venice, Italy. Consecrated in 1776, it boasts a neoclassical facade and a modest interior, now sometimes used for exhibitions. Its historical significance lies in its architecture and quiet position away from the main tourist throngs.

**🎥 In the Film**

This quaint Venetian church stood in for the exterior of the library where Indiana Jones and Dr. Elsa Schneider follow clues to find the resting place of the knight's tomb. It's here that Indy spectacularly bursts out of a manhole, emerging from the flooded catacombs beneath the building, narrowly escaping the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword.

It is the heart of Venice's iconic beauty and history.

**🎥 In the Film**

The Grand Canal provides the thrilling backdrop for one of the film's most exciting chase sequences.
