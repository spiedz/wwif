behindTheScenes:
  intro: "Richard Kelly's directorial debut, 'Donnie Darko,' is a masterclass in atmospheric filmmaking, achieved on a shoestring budget and tight schedule. The locations were carefully chosen to evoke a sense of suburban normalcy bordering on unsettling artifice, perfectly mirroring the film's blend of ordinary teenage life and cosmic horror. This grounded approach meant filming in real Southern California neighborhoods, which lends an authentic, lived-in feel to the surreal events unfolding."
  facts:
    - "The film was shot in just 28 days."
    - "Its initial box office performance was poor, grossing only $500,000 in its limited theatrical release."
    - "Drew Barrymore loved the script so much she signed on as an executive producer and took a small role as Ms. Pomeroy."
    - "Jake Gyllenhaal and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who play siblings Donnie and Elizabeth, are real-life brother and sister."
    - "The iconic 'Skeletons in the Closet' sequence was shot in Donnie's actual bedroom set, not a real closet."
    - "Several key scenes were filmed in Long Beach, including Donnie's house and the convenience store."
    - "The jet engine seen at the beginning and end of the film was a real prop, not CGI."
    - "The director's cut, released later, added 20 minutes of footage and clarified some plot points, though many fans prefer the original theatrical cut's ambiguity."
    - "The film's timeless soundtrack blend of 80s hits and original score was crucial to its cult appeal."
    - "Patrick Swayze, who plays the motivational speaker Jim Cunningham, originally read for the role of the principal before being cast in the more villainous part."
    - "Much of the crew worked for minimum wage or deferred payments due to the low budget."
    - "The production team extensively reused locations to save money, transforming them for different scenes."
