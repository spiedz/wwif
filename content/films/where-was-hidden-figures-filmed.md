behindTheScenes:
  intro: "Theodore Melfi's vision for 'Hidden Figures' was to honor the brilliant, unsung heroes of NASA's early space race, particularly the Black female mathematicians. He wanted to ground the inspiring narrative in authentic, period-accurate settings, even when those real locations were no longer available or suitable for filming. The production team meticulously recreated a 1960s feel, primarily transforming various spots in Atlanta, Georgia, to double for Virginia and the famed Langley Research Center."
  facts:
    - "The entire film was shot in just 45 days, a remarkably tight schedule for a period drama of this scale."
    - "Many of the scenes meant to be inside NASA's segregated facilities were built from scratch as meticulously detailed sets."
    - "Taraji P. Henson, who played Katherine G. Johnson, had the opportunity to meet the real Katherine Johnson before filming began."
    - "The movie earned over $230 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing Best Picture nominee of 2016."
    - "While depicting real events, some historical liberties were taken for dramatic impact, like Katherine Johnson's urgent run to the West Computing group to change calculations."
    - "Pharrell Williams served as one of the film's producers and also composed several original songs for the soundtrack."
    - "Director Theodore Melfi insisted on shooting the film on traditional film, not digital, to achieve a classic, timeless aesthetic."
    - "Octavia Spencer's role as Dorothy Vaughan was specifically written with her in mind by the filmmakers."
    - "The real Dorothy Vaughan retired from NASA in 1971, having become a supervisor and a FORTRAN programmer."
    - "Kevin Costner's role as Al Harrison was fictional, a composite character representing various leaders at NASA."
    - "Katherine Johnson lived to be 101, passing away in 2020, well after the film brought her story to global recognition."
    - "The film's success reignited interest in unsung heroes, leading to numerous books and documentaries about other overlooked historical figures."
