## 🗺️ Major Filming Locations

### 🎬 Maine North High School Gymnasium - The Heart of Detention ❤️

<img src="https://preview.redd.it/o0yps725tjf51.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5f75fbbc1a23d61fa28b367a3b2bbb927306835d" alt="Scenic view of Maine North High School Gymnasium showing the basketball court and bleachers." style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

**🏛️ The Location**

Maine North High School, located in Des Plaines, Illinois, was a former high school that closed its doors in 1981, just a few years before *The Breakfast Club* began filming. Its abandoned status made it the perfect blank canvas for filmmakers. Today, the building serves as a district administration center for Maine Township High School District 207.

**🎥 In the Film**

The expansive gymnasium of Maine North High School was the primary location for the entire film's main setting: the library. The production team built a complete library set inside the gym, creating the iconic detention room where the five strangers spent their Saturday. This allowed for maximum control over lighting and camera angles.

**📍 Visitor Info**

- **📍 Address:** 951 Ballard Rd, Des Plaines, IL 60016
- **🕒 Hours:** Not publicly accessible as a film location. It's an active administration building.
- **💰 Admission:** Free (for exterior viewing only)
- **🌐 Website:** https://www.maine207.org/

**💡 Pro Tip:** While you can't step inside the exact "library" anymore, you can still drive by and appreciate the building's exterior, knowing the magic that happened within its walls.

**🎬 Fun Fact:** The set for the library was so elaborate and convincing that many viewers assumed it was a real school library, not a temporary construction within a gym!

### 🎬 Maine North High School (Other Interiors) - Halls of Transformation 🚪

<img src="https://i.redd.it/o0yps725tjf51.jpg" alt="Stunning architecture of Maine North High School interiors featuring deserted hallways and classrooms." style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

**🏛️ The Location**

Beyond the gym, other interior spaces of Maine North High School were also utilized, providing the complete environment for "Shermer High." Its disused classrooms, hallways, and offices perfectly contributed to the film's isolated and slightly melancholic atmosphere. The building still stands as a testament to its past.

**🎥 In the Film**

While the library was the main stage, scenes like Principal Vernon's office, the hallways the kids sneak through, and other brief glimpses of the school's inner workings were filmed within these existing interiors. This added to the authentic feel of a functioning (or defunct) high school.

**📍 Visitor Info**

- **📍 Address:** 951 Ballard Rd, Des Plaines, IL 60016
- **🕒 Hours:** Not publicly accessible for tours or interior visits.
- **💰 Admission:** Free (for exterior viewing only)
- **🌐 Website:** https://www.maine207.org/

**💡 Pro Tip:** Try to imagine the "athletic wing" or the general school layout as you pass by. The building's architecture truly captures the essence of a typical American high school.

**🎬 Fun Fact:** Director John Hughes often preferred using real, accessible locations over soundstages, believing it added an invaluable layer of authenticity to his films.

New Trier High School is a highly-rated, active public high school located in Northfield, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago. Known for its distinctive red brick architecture and sprawling campus, it perfectly embodied the affluent suburban high school vibe that John Hughes frequently depicted.

**🎥 In the Film**

The striking exterior of New Trier High School served as the visual representation of "Shermer High" in *The Breakfast Club*. All the establishing shots, where the camera pans over the school building at the beginning and end of the film, were filmed here. It's the face of the fictional school!

**🏛️ The Location**

The spacious parking lots surrounding New Trier High School are typical of large suburban high schools. They are bustling hubs where students arrive and depart, a transitional space between home and school life. The ample space provides various angles for filming.

**🎥 In the Film**

The parking lot at New Trier was used for the opening and closing scenes of *The Breakfast Club*. This is where the parents dramatically drop off their children on that fateful Saturday morning, and where they pick them up at the end of the day. The parking lot frames the beginning and end of the characters' transformative journey.

**📍 Visitor Info**

- **📍 Address:** 385 Winnetka Ave, Northfield, IL 60093 (Parking areas surrounding the school)
- **🕒 Hours:** Active school parking; generally accessible during non-school hours or from public vantage points.

### 🎬 New Trier High School (Football Field) - Suburban Sprawl 🏈

<img src="https://www.musco.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/newtrier_1200x600-1024x512.jpg" alt="Authentic street scene of New Trier High School football field capturing the green turf and sports lighting." style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

**🏛️ The Location**

As part of New Trier High School's extensive campus, the football field is a standard athletic facility used for sports and other school events. Its well-maintained turf and imposing spectator stands are characteristic of many well-funded suburban schools.

**🎥 In the Film**

While not a central location, the football field of New Trier High School appears in some of the establishing shots, particularly at the beginning and end of the film. It helps to ground "Shermer High" in a realistic, large suburban high school setting, showing the scope of the campus beyond just the main building.

**📍 Visitor Info**

- **📍 Address:** 385 Winnetka Ave, Northfield, IL 60093 (Part of the larger New Trier campus)
- **🕒 Hours:** Accessible from public roads; field access typically restricted to school events.
- **💰 Admission:** N/A
- **🌐 Website:** https://www.newtrier.k12.il.us/

**💡 Pro Tip:** The views from the perimeter of the field offer a great perspective on the scale of the campus and the classic American high school experience.

## 🎬 Behind-the-Scenes Secrets

Dive a little deeper into the production of *The Breakfast Club* and discover what made this film a truly groundbreaking piece of cinema. It's full of tidbits that will make you appreciate it even more!

### 🎭 Director's Vision

- **🎯 Location Strategy:** John Hughes deliberately combined an abandoned school (Maine North) for interiors with an active, affluent one (New Trier) for exteriors to create a seamless, believable "Shermer High." This blend allowed for creative freedom on the set while maintaining a sense of realism.

- **🎨 Visual Style:** Hughes's vision focused on isolating the characters, making the school feel like a temporary prison. The extensive use of long takes and a single, principal set (the library) emphasized the claustrophobia and forced interaction, letting the dialogue and performances shine.

### 🎪 Production Highlights

- 🎬 **Rapid Scripting:** John Hughes wrote the entire script in just two days, fueled by a deep understanding of teen angst and social dynamics.

- 🎭 **Actor Chemistry:** The cast spent three weeks in intense rehearsals before filming, fostering the authentic on-screen chemistry that resonates so strongly.

- 🎨 **Set Building:** The iconic library set was not a real library but meticulously constructed within Maine North High School's gymnasium, allowing for specific shots and controlled environments.

- 🎯 **Improvisational Magic:** Several memorable lines and moments, including Bender's fist pump at the end, were ad-libbed by the actors, adding to the film's raw authenticity.

### 🌟 Cast & Crew Stories

- 😄 **The "Brat Pack" Bond:** Stories abound of the cast bonding off-screen, solidifying the idea of the "Brat Pack" and creating a tight-knit ensemble that translated to their performances.

- 😮 **Judd Nelson's Challenge:** John Hughes almost fired Judd Nelson (Bender) for staying in character too much off-camera and being difficult, but Paul Gleason (Principal Vernon) defended him, believing it fueled his performance.

- 🎉 **Cultural Impact:** The film became an instant classic, defining a generation and cementing John Hughes's legacy as the voice of 80s teens, proving that real stories about high school life resonated with millions.

## 🗺️ Plan Your Visit

Ready to explore "Shermer, Illinois" for yourself? While Maine North High School is no longer a public high school and New Trier High School is an active institution, you can still experience the magic of these locations.

### 🏨 Where to Stay

- **💰 Budget:** **Quality Inn O'Hare Airport - Des Plaines** - ~$90/night - Close to the Maine North location and offers convenient access to O'Hare Airport and surrounding suburbs.

- **🏛️ Mid-Range:** **Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago O'Hare Rosemont** - ~$180/night - Offers spacious suites and is centrally located for exploring both Des Plaines and Northfield, with easy expressway access.

### 🚗 Getting Around

- **🚇 Metro (Metra):** While not directly next to the schools, Metra's Union Pacific Northwest (UP-NW) line has stops in Des Plaines and the Milwaukee District North (MD-N) line has stops closer to New Trier. You'll need a ride-share for the final leg.

- **🚗 Car:** Driving is highly recommended for exploring these suburban locations. Chicago's expressways provide good access, and there's ample parking (though school parking lots are for school use during school hours).

### 📸 Photo Tips

- **🌅 Best Times:** Weekends or late afternoons are best for external shots at New Trier High School to avoid school traffic and respect student privacy. Natural light midday is great for building facades.

- **📱 Instagram Spots:** Capture the iconic red brick exterior of New Trier, the long entrance driveway, and shots appearing to be from the parking lot. At Maine North, focus on the overall building shape from afar.
