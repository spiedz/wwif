**🗺️ Can I visit all locations in one day?**

Visiting all locations in one day would be challenging. Princeton's campus locations are easily grouped, but Greystone (which is no longer a public site) and Newark Symphony Hall require significant travel time, making it better suited for a two-day itinerary.

**💰 How much should I budget?**

Expect to budget around $200-$400 per person per day, including accommodation, transportation (if renting a car), and food, depending on your choices. Campus visits are free, but tours or events at Newark Symphony Hall would add extra cost.

Princeton University offers student-led tours of the campus, showcasing its historic architecture and famous spots. For Newark Symphony Hall, check their website for event-specific tours or historical tours.

**🎭 When was this filmed?**

Principal photography for *A Beautiful Mind* took place from March to July 2001, allowing the filmmakers to capture the distinct seasons of New Jersey.
