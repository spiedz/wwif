## The Grand Budapest Hotel: A Fairytale of Central Europe

*The Grand Budapest Hotel* is one of Wes Anderson's most visually iconic films, set in the fictional Eastern European country of Zubrowka. While the story may be fictional, the locations are very real — and beautifully chosen. Filming primarily took place in Germany and the Czech Republic, where colorful facades, art nouveau interiors, and snowy landscapes created the film's unforgettable visual style.

Anderson and his production team were drawn to the town of Görlitz, Germany, which offered preserved pre-war architecture and a large, abandoned department store that became the interior of the hotel. For mountain scenes and skiing sequences, the Krkonoše range in the Czech Republic provided a dreamy, snow-covered backdrop that grounded the film in whimsical realism.

Production designers transformed existing structures rather than building new sets, giving the film an authenticity that shines through. Everything from train stations to bakeries were redressed with pastel colors and intricate props, helping transport viewers into Anderson's symmetrical world.

While the film is a quirky crime caper on the surface, it also reflects on war, loss, and nostalgia — themes deeply rooted in European history. The decision to shoot in real, lesser-known locations adds weight to those themes, creating a deeper emotional connection for viewers and travelers alike.
