## 🗺️ Plan Your Visit

Ready to follow in Peter Parker's footsteps? New York City is waiting! Here’s how to make your cinematic journey a breeze.

### 🏨 Where to Stay

- **✨ Luxury:** **The St. Regis New York** - ~$700+/night - Experience five-star luxury and impeccable service, putting you near Central Park and Fifth Avenue.

### 🚗 Getting Around

- **🚇 Metro:** NYC's subway is your best friend! It's the fastest and most efficient way to get between locations. Purchase a MetroCard as soon as you arrive.

- **🚗 Car:** Driving in NYC is not recommended for tourists due to traffic, expensive parking, and complex one-way streets. Save yourself the headache!

### 📸 Photo Tips

- **🌅 Best Times:** Early mornings are best for iconic landmarks like the New York Public Library to avoid crowds. Golden hour (just after sunrise or before sunset) offers beautiful light for all exterior shots.

- **📱 Instagram Spots:** Don't miss the steps of Columbia University, the grand lion statues outside the NYPL, or the vibrant energy of Broadway at night.

- **🎬 Movie Moments:** Try to recreate Peter's frantic dash across campus at Columbia, or capture the "New York hustle" feeling near The Strand Bookstore. If you make it to Chicago, snap pics of the 'L' trains for that iconic Doc Ock chase vibe!
