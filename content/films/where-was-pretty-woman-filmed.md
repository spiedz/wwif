## üé¨ Behind-the-Scenes Secrets

"Pretty Woman" holds a special place in cinematic history, but its journey to the screen was as dramatic and surprising as the film itself. From script overhauls to improvised moments that became iconic, the production was full of fascinating twists.

### üé≠ Director's Vision

- **üéØ Location Strategy:** Director Garry Marshall chose real, iconic L.A. landmarks to firmly root Vivian's fantastical transformation in a tangible world. The stark contrast between Hollywood Boulevard and Beverly Hills was essential to visually convey her journey.

- **üé® Visual Style:** Marshall aimed for a vibrant, aspirational, yet grounded look. The locations were selected to enhance the Cinderella narrative, making the "dream" tangible and the "reality" stark, highlighting Vivian's progress through the film's visual language.

### üé™ Production Highlights

- üé¨ **A Dark Beginning:** The film was originally titled "$3000" and had a much grittier, darker tone, with Vivian being a drug addict and the story ending ambiguously, without a "happily ever after."

- üé≠ **The Red Dress Saga:** Vivian's show-stopping red opera dress was nearly black. The costume designer, Marilyn Vance, initially wanted a black dress, but Garry Marshall insisted on red for more pop and cinematic impact. Good call!

- üé® **Necklace Magic:** The moment where Edward playfully snaps the necklace box on Vivian's fingers was completely improvised by Richard Gere. Julia Roberts' genuine, infectious laugh in that scene is real!

- üéØ **Cameo King:** Director Garry Marshall himself makes a brief cameo appearance in the film as a homeless man on Hollywood Boulevard, blending into the very landscape he helped bring to life.

### üåü Cast & Crew Stories

- üòÑ **Gere's Piano Skills:** Richard Gere actually plays the piano himself during the hotel lobby scene. He also composed the short piece of music he plays. Talk about multi-talented!

- üòÆ **Almost a Miss:** Julia Roberts was close to passing on the role due to the initial dark tone of the script. It was Garry Marshall's warm vision and commitment to a romantic comedy that convinced her.

- üéâ **Wardrobe Wizardry:** The film's costume designer, Marilyn Vance, was crucial to Vivian's transformation, creating looks that perfectly captured her evolution from street style to high fashion.
