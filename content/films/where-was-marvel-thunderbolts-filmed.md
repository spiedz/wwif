## Marvel's Thunderbolts: Filming Locations Revealed

*Thunderbolts* marks a bold new chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, focusing on a team of reformed (and not-so-reformed) anti-heroes. The film brings together familiar faces like [Yelena Belova](https://wherewasitfilmed.co/films/where-was-black-widow-filmed), Bucky Barnes, and U.S. Agent, and places them in grittier, more morally complex scenarios than your usual Avengers fare.

> Fans of [Captain America: Civil War](https://wherewasitfilmed.co/films/where-was-captain-america-civil-war-filmed) and [Black Widow](https://wherewasitfilmed.co/films/where-was-black-widow-filmed) will appreciate the darker tones and espionage-heavy narrative carried forward here.

### Key Filming Locations

While much of the Marvel machine runs through Atlanta, *Thunderbolts* took advantage of real-world cityscapes to heighten its grounded aesthetic.

#### 1. **Atlanta, Georgia**  
The majority of the production was filmed at Trilith Studios (formerly Pinewood Atlanta), Marvel's long-standing production base. Just like in [Ant-Man and the Wasp](https://wherewasitfilmed.co/films/where-was-ant-man-and-the-wasp-filmed), many interiors and VFX-heavy scenes were shot here.

#### 2. **Chicago, Illinois**  
Known for its dramatic skyline and layered street layouts, Chicago provided the perfect backdrop for chase sequences and urban espionage. This isn't the first time Marvel used Chicago â€” parts of [The Dark Knight](https://wherewasitfilmed.co/films/where-was-the-dark-knight-filmed) and [Spider-Man: Homecoming](https://wherewasitfilmed.co/films/where-was-spider-man-homecoming-filmed) were filmed in similar gritty urban settings.

#### 3. **Los Angeles, California**  
Used for studio reshoots and indoor scenes, L.A. provided the high-tech setting often associated with Marvel headquarters â€” a practice also seen in [Iron Man](https://wherewasitfilmed.co/films/where-was-iron-man-filmed).

### Travel Tips for Marvel Fans

- **Trilith Studios**: Though not open to the public, nearby areas in Fayetteville have hosted fan pop-ups and Marvel-themed events.
- **Chicago**: Take a DIY Marvel location tour by tracing some *Thunderbolts* sequences through Lower Wacker Drive.
- **Marvel Map**: Combine your trip with other MCU locations in Georgia featured in *Ant-Man*, *Wakanda Forever*, and *Infinity War*.

### Behind the Scenes

*Thunderbolts* leans into darker territory, with a tone Marvel has teased as "more grounded and brutal." The team's chemistry, especially between Yelena and Bucky, draws from earlier films like *The Falcon and the Winter Soldier* and *Black Widow*.
