More than just a thrilling narrative, "Kingdom" visually captivates with its stunning locations, which are far from fictional sets. The production team journeyed across South Korea, leveraging real historical sites to ground the fantastical elements in a palpable reality.

From the sprawling, traditional homes of the Korean Folk Village in Yongin to the majestic and historically significant Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul, the series transports viewers back to the Joseon Dynasty. These aren't just backdrops; they are integral parts of the story, lending authenticity and atmosphere to every scene. The winding alleys, the intricate palace architecture, and the serene, yet sometimes sinister, rural landscapes all play a crucial role in the unfolding drama.

Beyond the well-known tourist spots, "Kingdom" also utilized lesser-known, but equally captivating, locations like the Andong Hahoe Folk Village and Oeam Folk Village, showcasing the diverse beauty and historical depth of Korea. The mountainous regions surrounding temples like Goseong Unbongsansa added to the sense of a kingdom under siege, with characters navigating treacherous terrain alongside political minefields.

For fans of the series and history buffs alike, visiting these filming locations offers a unique opportunity to walk in the footsteps of the Crown Prince and experience the beauty of the Joseon era firsthand.
