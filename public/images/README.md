# Images Directory

This directory contains images for the Where Was It Filmed website.

## Directory Structure

- `/films` - Contains images related to film and TV show locations
- `/blog` - Contains images for blog posts

## Image Guidelines

When adding images:

1. Use descriptive filenames that include keywords (e.g., `dark-knight-chicago-building.jpg`)
2. Optimize images for web (compress, resize to appropriate dimensions)
3. Ensure you have rights/permissions to use all images
4. Include alt text when adding images to content
5. Use appropriate file formats:
   - JPG for photographs
   - PNG for images with transparency
   - SVG for icons and simple graphics
   - WebP when possible for better compression

## Image Naming Conventions

Format: `[topic]-[location]-[specific-descriptor].jpg`

Examples:
- `inception-paris-bridge.jpg`
- `stranger-things-hawkins-lab.jpg`
- `filming-location-travel-tips.jpg`

## Image Sizing

- Featured images: 1200 × 630 pixels (ideal for social sharing)
- Gallery images: 800 × 600 pixels
- Thumbnails: 400 × 300 pixels

Always maintain the same aspect ratio when resizing images.

## Image Optimization Tips

1. Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh to compress images
2. Remove EXIF data for privacy and smaller file sizes
3. Consider using responsive images with the `srcset` attribute
4. Lazy load images when possible

Remember that image quality and performance both matter for user experience!
