# WWIF Testing and Bug Fixing

This document outlines the testing performed and bugs fixed for the "Where Was It Filmed" website.

## Testing Approach

1. Manual Testing of Components
2. API Endpoint Testing
3. Content Rendering Tests
4. Responsive Design Testing
5. Error Handling Tests

## Identified Issues

1. **Comments Directory Issue**: The `data/comments` directory might not exist on initial setup
2. **Map Error Handling**: Missing proper error handling when Google Maps API key is missing
3. **Responsive Design Fixes**: Some components need adjustments for mobile view
4. **Behind the Scenes Section**: The hardcoded trivia section in Film page needs to be dynamic
5. **Date Formatting**: Potential date parsing errors if date is missing or invalid
6. **Missing Content Directory**: Ensure content directories are properly created

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Comments Directory Fix
- Enhanced the `comments.ts` utility with a new `initializeCommentsSystem()` function that ensures the comments directory exists
- Added automatic initialization in `_app.tsx` using `getInitialProps` to ensure directories are created on server startup
- Added better error handling for directory creation

### 2. Map Component Enhancement
- Added comprehensive error handling for missing Google Maps API key
- Created a fallback UI when API key is missing that still displays location information
- Improved loading states for better user experience
- Fixed mobile display with better control positioning

### 3. Dynamic Content Improvements
- Made the "Behind the Scenes" section on film pages dynamic based on content metadata
- Added a new `behindTheScenes` property to the `FilmMeta` interface that supports both string and structured data
- Improved TypeScript type safety with a dedicated `BehindTheScenes` interface

### 4. Date Formatting Safety
- Added error handling for date parsing in film and blog post pages
- Implemented graceful fallback to display raw date string if parsing fails
- Wrapped date formatting in try-catch blocks to prevent runtime errors

### 5. Directory Structure Testing
- Created a comprehensive testing script (`scripts/test-app.js`) that verifies all required directories exist
- Script automatically creates missing directories as needed
- Added test for content files to ensure minimum required content is present

### 6. Developer UX Improvements
- Added a new npm script `test:app` to run the testing/verification script
- Enhanced error reporting with colored terminal output for better readability
- Added option to start the development server from the test script

## Running the Tests

To verify the fixes:

1. Run `npm run test:app` to check directory structure and content files
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
3. Test the application in various scenarios:
   - With and without a Google Maps API key
   - With missing or malformed content dates
   - With and without the "Behind the Scenes" metadata

## Test Results

### Directory Structure Tests
- All required directories are now created automatically
- Missing directories are reported and created with proper error handling

### Content Integrity Tests
- Film and blog content is verified to ensure minimum required files exist
- Template files are accessible for creating new content

### Error Handling Tests
- Map component gracefully handles missing API key
- Date parsing errors are caught and handled properly
- Comment system works even if directories don't exist initially
